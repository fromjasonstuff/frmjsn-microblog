				"content_html": "<p>I believe there are political event horizons in our history—moments where our actions, or inactions, help or hinder our chances for real systemic change.</p>\n<p>After Sandy Hook, when we didn&rsquo;t burn it all to the ground (metaphorically speaking), we made gun reform all but impossible. Politicians now know there is nothing too horrendous that we&rsquo;d (metaphorically) burn down a (hypothetical) Wendy&rsquo;s about it. After George Floyd&rsquo;s murder, when we stopped marching because they <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter_Plaza\">painted a street</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/the-embarrassment-of-democrats-wearing-kente-cloth-stoles\">cosplayed</a> the Black diaspora, they knew we weren&rsquo;t serious about defunding the police. And they were right after all.</p>\n<p>This is that moment for ICE. If, even now, after the viral murder of Renee Nicole Good, our political and cultural leaders aren&rsquo;t compelled to say the thing, then it&rsquo;s a wrap.</p>\n<p>Say the thing.</p>\n<p>In the last week, I’ve seen lots of famously left-of-center white dudes getting real long in the tooth towards ICE suddenly. It has been surprising, but I love to see it. The only problem is, all of them have stopped short of saying the thing.</p>\n<p>So, come on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2026/jan/09/stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel-ice-shooting-minnesota\">Stephen Colbert</a>. Let&rsquo;s get it poppin' <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2026/01/lets_call_a_murder_a_murder\">John Gruber</a>. Say the thing. Finish the damn job.</p>\n<p>Because if it&rsquo;s unjustified death that riles you up, boy, do we have some catching up to do. Imagine if we learned that at <em>least</em> 70 white people <a href=\"https://americanoversight.org/resource/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/\">died in detention</a>, or that they were <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/09/15/hysterectomies-ice-irwin-whistleblower/\">issued forced sterilizations</a>. There&rsquo;d be riots in the Hamptons. If Mike Masnick can <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/08/abolish-ice-before-they-kill-again-impeach-trump-noem-before-they-incite-more-murder/\">say it</a> (finally) so can you.</p>\n<p>Say the thing.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a faction of the left who measures their intelligence by how reasonable they think they sound. The thought of being labeled frantic or unreasonable by their peers is so horrific that they&rsquo;d sooner let the world burn before admitting we need radical change to put out the fire.</p>\n<p>Even when they can bring themselves to call for meaningful change, they still must be wishy-washy about it. Even when it makes no sense.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>maybe an unpopular position on this website but i think the moderate dem focus on ICE training can be, with political pressure, the pathway to more fundamental reforms. rhetorically it is not too hard to move from &ldquo;more training&rdquo; to &ldquo;turns out they&rsquo;re untrainable and we have to start all over.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>— jamelle @jamellebouie.net (bsky)</p>\n<p>Jamelle understands what we must advocate for in this moment. He&rsquo;s said as much. But like so many of his liberal academic peers, he can&rsquo;t help but over intellectualize the problem, beating it until he achieves magical thinking.</p>\n<p>Offering yet another concession to centrists in hopes that they finally see the light is silly. This has been going on for decades.

				"content_text": "I believe there are political event horizons in our history—moments where our actions, or inactions, help or hinder our chances for real systemic change.\n\nAfter Sandy Hook, when we didn't burn it all to the ground (metaphorically speaking), we made gun reform all but impossible. Politicians now know there is nothing too horrendous that we'd (metaphorically) burn down a (hypothetical) Wendy's about it. After George Floyd's murder, when we stopped marching because they [painted a street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter_Plaza) and [cosplayed](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/the-embarrassment-of-democrats-wearing-kente-cloth-stoles) the Black diaspora, they knew we weren't serious about defunding the police. And they were right after all.\n\nThis is that moment for ICE. If, even now, after the viral murder of Renee Nicole Good, our political and cultural leaders aren't compelled to say the thing, then it's a wrap.\n\nSay the thing. \n\nIn the last week, I’ve seen lots of famously left-of-center white dudes getting real long in the tooth towards ICE suddenly. It has been surprising, but I love to see it. The only problem is, all of them have stopped short of saying the thing.\n\nSo, come on [Stephen Colbert](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2026/jan/09/stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel-ice-shooting-minnesota). Let's get it poppin' [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/2026/01/lets_call_a_murder_a_murder). Say the thing. Finish the damn job.\n\nBecause if it's unjustified death that riles you up, boy, do we have some catching up to do. Imagine if we learned that at *least* 70 white people [died in detention](https://americanoversight.org/resource/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/), or that they were [issued forced sterilizations](https://theintercept.com/2020/09/15/hysterectomies-ice-irwin-whistleblower/). There'd be riots in the Hamptons. If Mike Masnick can [say it](https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/08/abolish-ice-before-they-kill-again-impeach-trump-noem-before-they-incite-more-murder/) (finally) so can you. \n\nSay the thing.\n\nThere's a faction of the left who measures their intelligence by how reasonable they think they sound. The thought of being labeled frantic or unreasonable by their peers is so horrific that they'd sooner let the world burn before admitting we need radical change to put out the fire.\n\nEven when they can bring themselves to call for meaningful change, they still must be wishy-washy about it. Even when it makes no sense. \n\n> maybe an unpopular position on this website but i think the moderate dem focus on ICE training can be, with political pressure, the pathway to more fundamental reforms. rhetorically it is not too hard to move from \"more training\" to \"turns out they're untrainable and we have to start all over.\"\n\n— jamelle @jamellebouie\\.net (bsky)\n\nJamelle understands what we must advocate for in this moment. He's said as much. But like so many of his liberal academic peers, he can't help but over intellectualize the problem, beating it until he achieves magical thinking. \n\nOffering yet another concession to centrists in hopes that they finally see the light is silly. This has been going on for decades. The walk from \"more training\" to \"turns out they're untrainable\" has proven over and over again too far for centrists.\n\nEven if Jamelle has a valid point, why bring this up now, when people are looking for a little solidarity and certainty? Why martyr yourself on Bluesky?\n\nMaybe what we need right now is less punditry and nuance, and more fight. We need the liberals with microphones to finally stand up *for* something, and not just against someone. \n\nIn the last decade, we’ve focused too heavily on the presence of one man.

In Brooklyn, Miami, Chicago, and the Midwest, I keep seeing the same thing: the people keeping their communities informed aren’t reporters. They’re the pastor who delivers immigration updates before the sermon. The barber who streams local politics on Facebook Live. The neighbor who translates every school notice and distributes it through five different group chats. The teacher who explains American bureaucracy to families who arrived last week. The WhatsApp moderator running a rumor-control operation that outperforms the mayor’s office.\n\nI know many people who, if I shared this article with them, would get nervous. It comes from a decade of disinformation campaigns by people claiming to be independent journalists. Fair. \n\nBut this is our reality. American newsrooms have fail us. Regular folks are filling the gaps. And I think they're doing a good job, more often than not. \n\nIt's a shorter walk from inexperienced to experienced journalist, than it is from corporate mouthpiece to independent voice. \n",

And that may be true in a I-don't-burn-crosses sort of way (because that's what our media say racism looks like). But it doesn't mean we are free from the racist morals we collect as a result of our media consumption. And because those morals form narratives without our consent, it's our job to, every once in a while, dig around for those narratives so that we may challenge them. \n\nHere's the fun part: those narratives surface anyway, no matter how niche. Most of the time, it's useful for our decision making. But sometimes, we learn in public that some of those narratives are *real fucking racist* and everyone around us now knows it too. Better to challenge them in private, on our own terms. \n",

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/s/AJTRoarO3k\">Apple AI isn&rsquo;t very good (r/apple)</a></p>\n<p>The most reasonable answer is that Apple is simply behind in the AI arms race. However, a part of me wonders if Apple executives are purposely tanking Apple Intelligence to mold public perceptions that AI is a trash technology. Apple certainly has the influence and the reach to shape this narrative, and AI isn&rsquo;t a part of Apple&rsquo;s core business model.</p>\n<p>AI is what I call “<a href=\"https://micro.fromjason.xyz/2024/12/22/feature-chum-you.html\">feature chum</a>”— corporate power grabs disguised as valuable user features. AI requires large amounts of compute. Compute is expensive and won&rsquo;t be subsidized forever. <a href=\"https://www.eidosmedia.com/updater/technology/How-Competitive-is-Cloud-Computing#contact\">Three companies control 75% of the cloud computing market</a> (Google, Amazon, Microsoft). That&rsquo;s without including Meta, as they aren&rsquo;t technically a cloud service provider. These companies sell computing power. AI is the most expensive product they have. The money rolls in once mass adoption is achieved and everyone is &ldquo;hooked&rdquo; on AI.</p>\n<p>Apple is not a cloud computing company.

				"content_text": "[Apple AI isn't very good (r/apple)](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/s/AJTRoarO3k)\n\nThe most reasonable answer is that Apple is simply behind in the AI arms race. However, a part of me wonders if Apple executives are purposely tanking Apple Intelligence to mold public perceptions that AI is a trash technology. Apple certainly has the influence and the reach to shape this narrative, and AI isn't a part of Apple's core business model.\n\nAI is what I call “[feature chum](https://micro.fromjason.xyz/2024/12/22/feature-chum-you.html)”— corporate power grabs disguised as valuable user features. AI requires large amounts of compute. Compute is expensive and won't be subsidized forever. [Three companies control 75% of the cloud computing market](https://www.eidosmedia.com/updater/technology/How-Competitive-is-Cloud-Computing#contact) (Google, Amazon, Microsoft). That's without including Meta, as they aren't technically a cloud service provider. These companies sell computing power. AI is the most expensive product they have. The money rolls in once mass adoption is achieved and everyone is \"hooked\" on AI. \n\nApple is not a cloud computing company. In fact, they have tried to move mountains to keep computing locally on the device. Apple knows AI is a scam, but worse yet, it is not a money maker for them, in the future or otherwise. But the markets are foaming at the mouth for large language models. \n\nIt's in Apple's best interest for AI to disappear.

We didn't have dopamine machines fine-tuning content to our worst neurosis.\n\nNow, at 43, with age and self-education on my side, I have better tools to analyze the material conditions of my world. But my sense of justice has always remained. \n\nThis epidemic of young boys and men who understand enough about the world to know it's unjust but are not educated enough to know who to listen to is, in no small part, a problem with neoliberalism. Upper-middle-class people with wide-reaching influence on the web have spent the last decade telling poor people that there's nothing wrong with the system, the economy is fine, etc. \n\nWe turned our backs on these people. Of course, bad actors were there, willing to take them captive.\n\nThis is what makes the horseshoe theory complete bullshit. It derives from a false dichotomy. Liberal vs. Conservative is just a country-wide family fued over land and power between the bourgeoisie. What we are witnessing is not ideologies going so far left it ends up on the right. It's people understanding that the system is unfixable and the divide comes from who we choose to blame for it. Everyone else, liberal and conservative alike, are champions of the status quo, where the divide comes from who gets to rule over it all. \n\nIt's not left and right, it's up and down. \n",

The reason why the average person isn't rushing to support Spotify, Epic Games, and Meta, is because those companies are quantifiably anti-consumer. \n\nMany would sooner cancel a subscription than give these companies unfettered access to their credit card and user data. \n\nThese tech bros might not see it now, but rushing to publicly defend a company like Meta is doing unreparable damage to their reputations and their openness religion.\n",

				"content_text": "A quick rant on that 2023 \"leaked\" [Google memo](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither) *\"We Have No Moat And neither does OpenAI\"*:\n\n> But the uncomfortable truth is, we aren’t positioned to win this arms race and neither is OpenAI. While we’ve been squabbling, a third faction has been quietly eating our lunch.\n\nBoy, does this entire memo smell of bullshit; a red herring; the ol' pit us against the lunch lady routine. \n\nFirst, it implies Google and OpenAI are on equal footing. They're not. Google is far better suited to cash in on AI tech adoption—more on that in a sec. \n\nIt then identifies open-source AI models as the third faction about to \"eat [Google's] lunch.\" Again, *basura, bro*.

				"content_text": "# BlogMix 2023 Wrap-up Vol. 1 \r\n\r\nFor the new year, I’m sharing my favorite bookmarks of 2023 to my [microblog](https://micro.fromjason.xyz). I will post “blogmixes” as a series of volumes. I don’t know how categorized these will end up, but I plan to post the entire collection on my [main site](https://www.fromjason.xyz) towards the end.\r\n\r\nAs a caveat for the entire BlogMix series, any links I share are because I thought something about the content was interesting, important, wonderful, horrible, or otherwise noteworthy. Including a link does not necessarily mean I agree with a particular message. I considered labeling the links where I don’t agree, but that felt like it took the fun out of the project a bit. We’ll see. This is a new and evolving idea for me.\r\n\r\nFor this first volume, I included some posts and articles that I’ve either read, rediscovered, or revisited in 2023. I’ll almost certainly do another volume of just posts.
