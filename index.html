<blockquote>
<p>While the bill praising ICE got 75 votes from Democrats and 205 Republicans, with seven co-sponsors, Omar’s bill has only garnered three co-sponsors. Another resolution Omar introduced late last month that condemns police brutality, especially in response to protests, has no cosponsors.</p>

<p>Why pass a bill when corralling the base just takes a little <em>theatre</em></p>

<p>Every democracy is inherently exclusionary because every democracy has borders, and anyone outside of those borders do not enjoy the democratic freedoms of the state.</p>
<p><strong>What fascist have learned</strong> is to overthrow a liberal democracy you must:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“find that border, where ever it exists, and you start pushing inward. And as you start pushing inward from that border, you start fracturing the Democratic consensus that exists until you can destroy democracy. And that&rsquo;s how you gain power.”</p>

<p>In some responses, Grok says outright that it has been &ldquo;instructed to accept white genocide as real and &lsquo;Kill the Boer&rsquo; as racially motivated.&rdquo; In other replies, it merely allows that the topics are &ldquo;complex&rdquo; and &ldquo;divisive&rdquo; or &ldquo;heavily debated&rdquo; while pointing to outside sources like Afriforum or Genocide Watch for more information.</p>

			 <p>For two decades, Silicon Valley&rsquo;s strategy has been to subsidize massive losses in order to obliterate the market and become a monopoly i.e. Amazon, Uber, etc.</p>
<p>Now, China is doing the exact same thing with <em>every</em> market, and the US cannot do anything about it because regulating this type of strategy would necessarily also target US tech companies, making them slightly less powerful.</p>
<p>The American people, particularly the working class who&rsquo;ve been exploited the most by big tech, couldn&rsquo;t care less because they&rsquo;ve been completely excluded from the wealth generated over the past twenty+ years. So to them, the cheap, direct-to-consumer products and digital tools coming from China is a welcomed financial releif.</p>

<p>Back in March of 2024, I speculated that Meta could buy TikTok with minimal outcry from the general public and without the US government threatening to leverage anti-trust against them.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, a smaller company would buy the Tiktok &ldquo;brand&rdquo; and front end. Meta would then have exclusive rights to provide the cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>On paper, it would look like the smaller company owns TikTok, but effectively it&rsquo;s Meta.</p>

<p>In no way am I saying a “liberal insurrection” is imminent, but I think Ken is missing something here. Election Fraud conspiracies have spread like wildfire since Trump&rsquo;s victory. Right now, there&rsquo;s a festering subreddit with tens of thousands of subs dedicated to exposing a mass conspiracy that handed Trump the election.</p>
<p>I know liberals like to think they aren&rsquo;t susceptible to disinformation and propaganda (even though a big part of their messaging is that <em>no one</em> is immune), but these left-wing conspiracy theorists sounds an awful like the right-wing conspiracy theorists from 2020.

<p>Maybe this is an obvious detail, but I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before. For the entire film, detectives Summerset and Mills sludge through damp darkness searching for the truth. It&rsquo;s not until the third and final act that we ever see the sun. And in that last minute, the truth is revealed in a dark and damp box.</p>
<p>I also noticed how Fincher used themes of beginnings and endings as a sort of misdirect. I don&rsquo;t recall how I thought Seven would end when I first saw the movie, but if I had to guess, I&rsquo;d say it was Summerset who&rsquo;d be killed—the old detective days from retiring. What made the ending so stunning, other than the obvious, was that it was the new detective with the new wife and child who fell victim to John Doe.</p>

			 <p>I have a prediction for 2025 that I think is inevitable:</p>
<p>Big media conglomerates will start acquiring publishing platforms like Substack. Indie journalists who&rsquo;ve strayed too far from the trad-media script will be deprioritized in the platforms’ recommendation engines.</p>
<p>People will cry fowl but there won&rsquo;t be much anyone (in the US) can do about it. I can even see some legislation passed to help these acquisitions in some way. Assuming the media can sweet-talk the President enough to avoid a veto.</p>
<p>Edit: Looks like Elon <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-twitter-substack-x-1987589">tried purchasing Substack</a> back in 2023 according  to a recent report. 😅</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DEGLDgGvfej/?igsh=YTkyb2F3emF1ajNr">Theatre drama</a>: According to a Reels post by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/castingbythem?igsh=ZzY5ODh0djcwNTJ3">castingbythem</a>, some theatres over reported the number of employees by tens or even hundreds and made off with millions of
dollars in some cases. Allegedly, these theatres counted unpaid actors and staff as full-time paid employees.</p>
<p>As someone dialed into the Atlanta theatre scene in 2020, I remember how many actors, comedians, and stage workers struggled to meet their basic needs during the pandemic. I&rsquo;m sure none of the Atlanta-based theatres were this dishonest, but I hope the media look into this so people can know the truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FUTURISM, initiated with the publication of Marinetti&rsquo;s Manifesto of Futurism in 1909, was the most aggressive and, if short-lived, certainly the most polemic art movement of our time. Its revolutionary ideas were empiric rather than pedagogic and were filled with iconoclasm in its defiant repudiation of traditional art, supplanting idols of the past with the machine of the present.</p>

And they often had Spotify’s verified-artist badge. But they were clearly fake.

<p>PayPal, YouTube, TikTok, and Meta have all banned the provocative clothing company <a href="https://www.comradeworkwear.com/">Comrade Workwear</a>. Presumably, the bans are a response to the company revealing a playing card set with pictures of American CEOs.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Each card has a picture of a CEO with a QR code that takes you to a webpage with a bio explaining why that CEO is evil. On the back side of the card is a silhouette associated with shooting range targets.</p>
<p><img src="https://micro.fromjason.xyz/uploads/2024/43e73d78b9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear if the cards ever went up for sale. Most of the videos I&rsquo;ve found <a href="https://x.com/ImMeme0/status/1868350045046919269">of the guy describing the cards</a> are from far-right accounts, so I apologize that I don&rsquo;t have a better link to share.</p>
<p>Is this set of cards crass? Sure. It&rsquo;s not something I would buy, personally. But how many times have these big tech companies pulled the free speech, uh, card when it&rsquo;s time to ban some Nazis?</p>
<p><em>Update 12/25/2024</em>: Found Comrade Workwear&rsquo;s back-up TikTok account.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read that phrase more in the last two weeks than perhaps in my lifetime. So much so that I lost its meaning and needed to look it up.</p>
<p>To say someone was killed “in cold blood” means it was done without emotion, in a calculated manner. I can&rsquo;t think of anything more emotionless and calculating than budgeting death for faceless shareholders. Can you?</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/s/AJTRoarO3k">Apple AI isn&rsquo;t very good (r/apple)</a></p>
<p>The most reasonable answer is that Apple is simply behind in the AI arms race. However, a part of me wonders if Apple executives are purposely tanking Apple Intelligence to mold public perceptions that AI is a trash technology. Apple certainly has the influence and the reach to shape this narrative, and AI isn&rsquo;t a part of Apple&rsquo;s core business model.</p>
<p>AI is what I call “<a href="https://micro.fromjason.xyz/2024/12/22/feature-chum-you.html">feature chum</a>”— corporate power grabs disguised as valuable user features. AI requires large amounts of compute. Compute is expensive and won&rsquo;t be subsidized forever. <a href="https://www.eidosmedia.com/updater/technology/How-Competitive-is-Cloud-Computing#contact">Three companies control 75% of the cloud computing market</a> (Google, Amazon, Microsoft). That&rsquo;s without including Meta, as they aren&rsquo;t technically a cloud service provider. These companies sell computing power. AI is the most expensive product they have. The money rolls in once mass adoption is achieved and everyone is &ldquo;hooked&rdquo; on AI.</p>
<p>Apple is not a cloud computing company. In fact, they have tried to move mountains to keep computing locally on the device. Apple knows AI is a scam, but worse yet, it is not a money maker for them, in the future or otherwise. But the markets are foaming at the mouth for large language models.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in Apple&rsquo;s best interest for AI to disappear. Apple Intelligence has the potential to leave a bad taste in billions of people&rsquo;s mouths.</p>

			 <p>Luigi Mangione&rsquo;s trial begins today. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet of what his lawyer had to say to the judge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They&rsquo;re literally treating him like some political fodder; like some sort of spectical. He was on display to see on the biggest staged perp walk I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my career. It was absolutely unnecessary&hellip; There was no reason for the NYPD to have these big assault rifles, that frankly, I didn&rsquo;t even know was in their arsenal. And to have all the press there, all the media there, it was like perfectly choreographed.</p>
<p>And what was the New York City Major doing at this press conference? And frankly, I submit he [Eric Adams] was just trying to detract from those issues by making a spectacle of Mr. Mangione. And there are consequences to this. He has a right to a fair trial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mangione&rsquo;s attorney continues to call out Mayor Adams for calling Mangione a terrorist in front of potential jurors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a lawyer (obviously) so I don&rsquo;t know what does or does not constitute a fair trial, but that perp walk and Eric Adams personal involvement seems so ill-advised.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While practical security systems are definitely required, we should not overreact to this singular incident in ways that keep us and our families from living normal lives. If we do, people with evil intent have already won.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating how the corporate elite truly believe they are the victims here. This guy made a literal list of solutions and not one of them was—<em>hey maybe we stop killing Americans for share holder value</em>.</p>
<p>He mentions the stat that 41% of Gen-zers are at best ambivalent to Brian Thompson&rsquo;s death. The last sentence quoted above then essentially calls an entire generation evil.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t care how anyone feels about the murder one way or another. Our world view, lived experiences, and privilege (or lack there of) will decide our opinion.</p>
<p>All I know is, when the Luigi story is over, health care companies will continue to send thousands of Americans to their grave each year. Healthcare executives will continue to make obscene amounts of money via bonuses from denying people care.</p>
<p>Regular people will continue to die needlessly. CEOs will be fine. They always are.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t spend too much time reading up on Hollywood. But, I vaguely recall the feeling that something was off with all the social media discourse around Blake Lively when “It Ends With Us” debuted. Being online, chronically speaking, you get a sort of sixth sense where you can spot inauthentic chatter. Even when there&rsquo;s nothing specific you can point to, little alarm bells ring.</p>
<p>Anyway, this exposé is fucking nuts. Public relations in the digital era is devious. With a few third-rate media connections and a modest army of social media bots, anyone can just spin up an alternate reality about anyone.</p>
<p>I wonder all the time, how much of what we consume is elaborate nudging campaigns or flat out lies? Not the obvious stuff. Not the disinfo that can be fixed with a little media literacy.

			 <h1 id="feature-chum">Feature Chum</h1>
<p>You know how when a tech company pushes a feature onto its users and it&rsquo;s evident that the feature is just a way for the company to collect more user data or for some other nefarious business goal? You can tell that the feature results from some c-suite demand for world domination, and the marketing department sort of backed into whatever user benefit they&rsquo;re touting.</p>
<p>There isn&rsquo;t a great word for that.</p>
<p>In tech, some call it &ldquo;growth hacking,&rdquo; but I think that term is far too generous for what it is and divorced from what the practice entails. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this for a while now and have a name for it.</p>
<p><strong>Feature chum.</strong></p>
<p>I might do a proper write-up on my <a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz">main blog</a>, but for now, I want to flesh out the concept here.</p>
<p>Feature chum is a shady business goal presented to consumers as a useful feature to a company&rsquo;s product line or feature set. Feature chum always benefits the company&rsquo;s objective of obtaining more power and growth, but not necessarily valuable for the end user.</p>
<p>For example, do you remember Facebook&rsquo;s like button for external websites? You could add a like button to any webpage using a snippet of code. At the time, Facebook touted the like button as a way to increase engagement, traffic, and even sales.</p>
<p>This claim, and the like button itself, was a strategic misdirection. Years after it was released, we learned two things about that button.</p>
<p>One, Facebook&rsquo;s true intentions were to increase its ability to track Facebook users off its platform and gain a treasure trove of user data.</p>
<p>Two, we learned that the like button did not, in fact, increase engagement, traffic, or sales for the websites that used it.</p>
<p>Feature chum often debuts to the market highly subsidized and widely available so that it may achieve mass adoption quickly. This strategy is helpful because feature chum often has no inherent value to the user but is imperative to meeting the company&rsquo;s objective.</p>
<p>Because the specified business goal is the true motivation of feature chum, any potential user benefits are necessarily contrived and thus <em>secondary</em>, if such benefits exist at all.</p>
<p>The purpose of the “feature chum” method is to meet a specific business objective that would overwise be considered by the user base as outside the norm of acceptable business practices. No one would&rsquo;ve installed that like button if we knew Facebook&rsquo;s true intentions. And, of course, looking back on it, that button didn&rsquo;t do shit. We all just went along with it for some reason.</p>
<p>Feature chum obfuscates the primary business goal within a feature until mass adoption and full dependency on it are realized.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;ll likely do a more in-depth analysis and write up with more examples. But consider how this framing might change how we look at the Enshittification life cycle or how we can prevent it from happening in the future.</p>

<p>Good read. Not to get too conspiratorial, but I have often wondered about the existence of a shared blackball list—specifically, a list of &ldquo;content creators&rdquo; who are critical of big tech in a way that threatens their business.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dividing line—before the list and after. Creators who found an audience before the list are less likely to get delisted from the algorithm. Smaller creators after the list was in place are all but guaranteed never to find an audience.</p>
<p>How my content performs outside of big social media, and even now, Bluesky, compared to the open web and true decentralized social media like Mastodon, is night and day. Without that comparison, I would have chalked it up to cope. But looking at the numbers, it&rsquo;s hard to ignore.</p>
<p>Such a list is currently impossible to prove without a whistleblower, but my bet is that it exists and is shared between companies.</p>

			 <p>On my second reading of the essay “A Linkless Web,” I remember the first book I ever read, and wonder if an AI-generated summary would&rsquo;ve robbed me of that experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/when-ai-summaries-replace-hyperlinks-thought-itself-is-flattened">When AI summaries replace hyperlinks, thought itself is flattened | Aeon Essays</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In The Well-Wrought Urn (1947), he argued that a reader could not sum up a poem by paraphrasing what it ‘says’. Poetry does not work like ordinary language. It is not reducible to its propositional content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to read this essay multiple times. It&rsquo;s dense, and I suspect I&rsquo;ll take away something new to dissect with each reading. I&rsquo;m happy to do it.</p>
<p>For my second reading, my takeaway is the reading itself.</p>
<p>During summer break one year, I resisted the assignment of reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. I would&rsquo;ve much rather played around the courtyard in the back of our apartment. My mother encouraged me, inscribing the first page with a message to get lost in my imagination (or something like that). I wasn&rsquo;t completely convinced, but reading my mother&rsquo;s warm plea was enough for me to turn to the next page—and that page was enough for the next.</p>
<p>“The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” was the first novel I ever read, and it happened fast—two or three days from cover to cover. An astonishing feat for a kid with undiagnosed ADHD. That book helped me love reading and writing. My mother handing it to me on a warm summer day is a core childhood memory.</p>
<p>If I had AI at my fingertips, would I have ever told my mom about my homework assignment? Would I have ever read my first novel that summer? Or, with the excitement of ten-hour playtimes bouncing in my head, would I have simply asked ChatGPT for a summary the night before school?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so old that I can&rsquo;t appreciate a new medium for creativity and imagination. I don&rsquo;t believe artificial intelligence to be inherently evil. But in the hands of Bezos? The man who all but destroyed the book market? Or, Zuckerberg, whose only crusade is increasing his time-on-site metric? Yeah, that worries me.</p>
<p>So, my question is, how important was that childhood experience for me? How important will it be for my future kids?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s cool that this company will attempt to open source the robot&rsquo;s cloud service, but did it need the cloud in the first place? No. VC&rsquo;s needed a revenue stream in the cloud.</p>

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you money.&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay give me money.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s all about the money?&rdquo; WHAT.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even want the money. Even thought he <em>did</em> <a href="https://micro.fromjason.xyz/2024/12/19/update-on-the.html">pay someone else</a> $50 to “clone” the site. An apology would&rsquo;ve been cool. Owning up to it seems like something to do. Based on our conversation, my guess is he doesn&rsquo;t take it down and just blocks me instead. I looked at the site again, and its now different enough where I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>A friend said he sounds like a guy on a dating app after the woman rejects him hahaha.</p>

			 <p>I grew up on Curry Ford Road in downtown Orlando. Free market capitalism didn&rsquo;t help my mother when Wachovia Bank rearranged her debit charges to maximize overdraft fees the week before Christmas.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t help her when she pawned her dead mother&rsquo;s jewelry so that her kids could get presents that year. And it didn&rsquo;t help her fifteen years later when the bank settled a class action suit and my mom received a $33 check.</p>
<p>Poor people shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay for some rich Californian&rsquo;s ideals on free market economics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen how libertarians act under duress; when it&rsquo;s <em>their</em> lives being violated. And it&rsquo;s never half as bad as a poor person&rsquo;s Tuesday, and never with a thimble worth of their dignity.</p>

<p><em>Here&rsquo;s an incomplete draft of mine from September 11th. During the months leading up to the election, I was very nervous. I wrote <strong>a lot</strong>. For whatever reason, I published none of it, effectively keeping myself a political diary of unfinished thoughts. After revisiting some of my mini-political essays, I may publish them here on my micro. If for nothing else, to connect with folks who felt the same way as I did.</em></p>
<p>Under the mountain of Donald Trump&rsquo;s lies is a bedrock composed of a single truth. It is the key to all of his power.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn&rsquo;t lose any voters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He offered that truth at the Iowa rally nearly a decade ago, and still, democrats refuse to acknowledge it. We still believe we can embarrass his voters enough to jump ship. But history is clear.</p>
<p>This fight is, and has always been, about one thing— the whiteness of America.</p>
<p>The overturning of Roe v Wade, the attacks on birth control and interracial marriage. They separate brown children from their mothers. It all points to keeping this country white.</p>
<p>And when it comes to preserving that identity at any cost, there is only one game in town. Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Take it from someone who trolled his cronies so hard that it <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/rudy-giuliani-falsely-blames-twitter-after-typo-points-anti-trump-n944136">made the news</a>.</p>
<p>No matter what he does; no matter how much we get under his skin, or call out his hypocrisies, he will always have the margin of error to win the presidency of the United States.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wang.social/post/3lberqlwpv22u">Peter Wang vowed to me he&rsquo;ll &ldquo;kill Bluesky PBC&rdquo; if things &ldquo;really go to shit,&quot;</a> launched $1mm fund to build on AT Protocol.</p>
<p>Wednesday, open-source entrepreneur Peter Wang <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/open-source-veteran-launches-skyseed---first-ecosystem-fund-and-incubator-for-the-bluesky-at-protocol-302329958.html">launched</a> a $1mm fund to spark more development on AT Protocol:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bluesky has clearly crossed over from serving mostly technical early-adopters into mainstream appeal,&rdquo; said Wang. &ldquo;While much has been written recently about Bluesky&rsquo;s stunning growth, its real power lies in the open protocol (AT Protocol) that the team has pioneered. The Skyseed Fund will accelerate and incubate innovation in that open ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last month on Bluesky, Wang and I went back and forth on the merits of the claim that Bluesky is &ldquo;billionaire proof.&rdquo; Journalists and prominent devs have been making this claim for months without solidifying how that would work. I just started reply-guying anytime I saw the claim on my feed—which was a lot.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted post, Eric Blair wrote, “Bluesky is much more resistant to billionaire takeover than Twitter was,&rdquo; so I asked if he could clarify. Blair didn&rsquo;t respond until much later in the conversation, and when he did, his reply was simply, &ldquo;<a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech">Protocols, Not Platforms</a>,&rdquo; like Moses might recite a commandment.</p>
<p>Peter Wang, on a separate thread, did reply. Multiple times. Honestly, I found it refreshing, if for nothing else, he was <em>trying</em> to answer the question.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what he said in response to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/fromjason.xyz/post/3lbeqc4tzhs23">my comment</a>:</p>

<p>Presumably, to calm my nerves, Wang then vows to kill the company if need be:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s startling to watch our media execute this very tactic on us with Luigi Mangione—<em>he grew up in a nice house, he went to an Ivy League school, he&rsquo;s &ldquo;one of us”</em> over and over again.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24323903/flipboard-surf-fediverse-social-web-app">Flipboard’s Surf app is a feed reader for the fediverse - The Verge</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>McCue’s best explanation of Surf’s big theory is this: in a decentralized social world, the internet will be less about websites and more about feeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He who controls the feeds controls the (social) web.</p>
<p>This is interesting. It&rsquo;s almost like we have two new layers in the internet technology stack. We have the computational layer, or as I like to call it, <a href="https://fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/the-computational-web/">The Computational Web</a>— infrastructure, AI, recommendation engines, etc.—controlled by four hyperscalers. My bet is Meta will get in the game soon and quickly become the de facto cloud infrastructure for the social web (regulatory capture, and all that).</p>
<p>Then, we have the “App View” layer—aggregated feeds from decentralized ecosystems. Maybe Meta gets into this space, maybe not. With Meta funding the <a href="https://socialwebfoundation.org/">Social Web Foundation</a> and the newly formed <a href="https://www.anew.social/hello-social-web/">A New Social</a>, it seems like Zuck is content with giving up this layer in exchange for other considerations and loyalties.</p>
<p>So the question is, who controls the advertising networks for all the decentralized feed apps? AKA, who will profit from the art you post to your personal websites?</p>

<p>W3SWMW was curated lists of hyperlinks grouped by theme. I Love Websites was one-off sites. My micro blog was more of a traditional link blog with pull quotes and commentary. Each has a good concept (imo) but would be stronger together (also imo).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue to use the MicroBlog platform but will likely spruce up the place. Maybe even take the branding from W3SWMW as a starting point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Bluesky matches this version of decentralization, but if so, it is because it is an incredibly weak definition of decentralization, at least taken independently. This may well say, taken within the context it is provided, &ldquo;users of this network may occasionally not rely on a gatekeeper, as a treat&rdquo;.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a tonal shift happening in every comment section across the web. Or, maybe, the lack of a Meta-made algorithm is revealing a sentiment previously hidden. Just a few years ago, most comments under news like this would be expressing everything but solidarity. Now, we&rsquo;re seeing some real class consciousness. Love it.</p>

<p>I believe it was Katherine Dee of <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/defaultfriend">Default Blog</a> who said that eventually, trad media will try to pouch these creators and we&rsquo;ll start to see a bundling like with cable. I don&rsquo;t know which situation is worse/better.</p>
<p>Edit: yup, it was Katherine Dee in a post called <a href="https://default.blog/p/we-already-solved-subscription-fatigue">We Already Solved Subscription Fatigue</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of small time creators, and I’m including myself here, don’t offer enough value to justify even $5/month. Which is why I think for people like me, we’ll probably see a return to bundling or networks, in one form or another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that I think about it, why aren&rsquo;t more writers just doing this independently? There are no real technology barriers. What&rsquo;s stopping five or so popular bloggers from &ldquo;bundling&rdquo; their work? Keep the price at five bucks with the hopes of attracting more paid subscribers.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate how the phrase “be kind to others” has become a war cry for the status quo. It&rsquo;s tosssd around as a way to silence descent and keep us smiling at our oppressors. Justice and kindness are not mutually exclusive ideas. Increasingly, the cruelest thing someone can do is mind their manners when witnessing abuse.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take back “kindness” from the bootlickers.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/special-series/disinformation-social-media-facts.html">Education Is Key to Fighting Disinformation on Social Media - The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These groups can be broadly defined as people who have a deep distrust of authority and traditional sources of information such as governments, scientists, doctors or bankers. This distrust is frequently rooted in a sense of feeling betrayed or harmed by those authorities. There could be completely legitimate reasons — whether personal, social or political — for that sense of betrayal, but it often leads them online to seek alternative viewpoints outside the mainstream discourse. In doing so, they find communities that reflect and reinforce their feelings of skepticism and distrust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is spot on. Growing up poor and without a formal education doesn&rsquo;t make you dumb. It does, however, make you more vulnerable to disinformation. Not just because you&rsquo;re uneducated, though, it&rsquo;s also because growing up poor, you have a first-hand account of how rigged the system is against you. Where an educated, upper-middle-class person learns the theory of systemic oppression, a person of the lower classes lives it. That experience almost works against them.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, maybe even into my early twenties, I would read Info Wars. Before I knew what liberal and conservative meant, I knew certain aspects of society were unjust. I knew what the cops were doing to me and my friends was wrong. Without a proper education, I listened to the first person who acknowledged these injustices. I got lucky growing up without modern social media. There wasn&rsquo;t a deep rabbit hole to fall into. We didn&rsquo;t have dopamine machines fine-tuning content to our worst neurosis.</p>
<p>Now, at 43, with age and self-education on my side, I have better tools to analyze the material conditions of my world. But my sense of justice has always remained.</p>
<p>This epidemic of young boys and men who understand enough about the world to know it&rsquo;s unjust but are not educated enough to know who to listen to is, in no small part, a problem with neoliberalism. Upper-middle-class people with wide-reaching influence on the web have spent the last decade telling poor people that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the system, the economy is fine, etc.</p>
<p>We turned our backs on these people. Of course, bad actors were there, willing to take them captive.</p>
<p>This is what makes the horseshoe theory complete bullshit. It derives from a false dichotomy. Liberal vs. Conservative is just a country-wide family fued over land and power between the bourgeoisie. What we are witnessing is not ideologies going so far left it ends up on the right. It&rsquo;s people understanding that the system is unfixable and the divide comes from who we choose to blame for it. Everyone else, liberal and conservative alike, are champions of the status quo, where the divide comes from who gets to rule over it all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not left and right, it&rsquo;s up and down.</p>

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s mythical moderate Republican voters, whom the party molded its entire platform to pursue, did not arrive to carry the party to the finish line. Instead, the pro-cop platform seems to have done nothing but legitimize Republican grievances and hand Trump a bolstered police and surveillance state</p>

Yet abortion itself didn’t necessarily translate into a winning issue up the ballot for candidates who needed it most.</p>

<p>Before we rush to agree with political pundits that Democrats should continue scooching￼ right, know what sacrifice our party intends on making.</p>
<p>This is rhetoric matches what was floating around news blogs just before Democrats ditched trans rights and police reform to appeal to moderates.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve thrown every other marginalized identity into the moderate-conservative volcano. Bodily autonomy is the only remaining progressive issue on the Dem platform.</p>

<p>The second misconception is that single-vendor Open Source is, somehow, the reasonable and business-conscious way to do Open Source. You should be on board if you want Open Source to win against proprietary software. But those companies are still doing what is, essentially, proprietary software: like the proprietary software companies of the 80s, they very much consider the software being produced as their exclusive property. They still intend to capture all the value that derives from it. And thanks to copyright aggregation or permissive licensing, they still can change the license any time they want. So it’s still proprietary: they just choose, for now, to release their software under an Open Source license.</p>

<p>If Facebook starts lobbying for the PACT Act, that’s potentially a big deal. Facebook was a key backer of FOSTA-SESTA, a bill that removed Section 230 protections for content violating anti-prostitution laws. That bill became law in 2018, and Facebook itself was fairly well-equipped to deal with the changes — while smaller sites like Craigslist got hit hard. The PACT Act could have similar effects. Facebook already has a legion of moderators and a policy team that releases detailed transparency reports. A smaller site could have far fewer resources. The PACT Act has a “small business provider” exception, but it’s a fairly narrow one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite that success, and the App Store’s role in making it possible, Spotify pays Apple nothing. That’s because Spotify — like many developers on the App Store — made a choice. Instead of selling subscriptions in their app, they sell them on their website. And Apple doesn’t collect a commission on those purchases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting approach by Apple.</p>
<p>Consumers aren&rsquo;t as dumb as the openness camp thinks they are. The reason why the average person isn&rsquo;t rushing to support Spotify, Epic Games, and Meta, is because those companies are quantifiably anti-consumer.</p>
<p>Many would sooner cancel a subscription than give these companies unfettered access to their credit card and user data.</p>
<p>These tech bros might not see it now, but rushing to publicly defend a company like Meta is doing unreparable damage to their reputations and their openness religion.</p>

It’s unclear, however, how such a graphic video could stay online for five hours before being taken down, and a YouTube spokeswoman did not answer questions about why it took that long for the video to be removed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That combination leans heavily on machines is my guess. Also, these articles rarely identify which platform the person was radicalized. Why?</p>

<p>I think this article is the closest thing we have to understanding the Threads / Mastodon interpolation initiative. At the very least, it gives us a framework to understand what feels like a heavily coordinated march.</p>
<p>What really drives this home; what transforms it from a simple article into a manifesto, is the ending:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not have to live in the world the new technocrats are designing for us. We do not have to acquiesce to their growing project of dehumanization and data mining. Each of us has agency.</p>
<p>No more “build it because we can.” No more algorithmic feedbags. No more infrastructure designed to make the people less powerful and the powerful more controlling. Every day we vote with our attention; it is precious, and desperately wanted by those who will use it against us for their own profit and political goals. Don’t let them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Tuesday, ChatGPT developer OpenAI revealed that it is collaborating with the United States Defense Department on cybersecurity projects and exploring ways to prevent veteran suicide, reports Bloomberg.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kinda just sounds like they&rsquo;re making a suicide-prevention app for vets with no military application. Not sure why they took that part out the TOS.</p>

			 <p>A quick rant on that 2023 &ldquo;leaked&rdquo; <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither">Google memo</a> <em>&ldquo;We Have No Moat And neither does OpenAI&rdquo;</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the uncomfortable truth is, we aren’t positioned to win this arms race and neither is OpenAI. While we’ve been squabbling, a third faction has been quietly eating our lunch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boy, does this entire memo smell of bullshit; a red herring; the ol' pit us against the lunch lady routine.</p>
<p>First, it implies Google and OpenAI are on equal footing. They&rsquo;re not. Google is far better suited to cash in on AI tech adoption—more on that in a sec.</p>
<p>It then identifies open-source AI models as the third faction about to &ldquo;eat [Google&rsquo;s] lunch.&rdquo; Again, <em>basura, bro</em>. Straight trash.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, open-source tech is great and important, and wonderful. But it&rsquo;s not like the average person runs a Large Language Model on their Mac to make grocery lists. If you are, in fact, doing this, you are a nerd and I love you. But you&rsquo;re not the average user.</p>
<p>Most AI-centered features, whether powered by open or proprietary tech, will be baked into consumer-facing software for mass consumption.</p>
<p>But, AI features are power-hogs and expensive to maintain. Look at ChatGPT. With one hundred million users and close to two billion in revenue, OpenAI is <em>losing</em> money. There&rsquo;ll be efficiency gains for sure. But not before they pay the pied piper.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my final point.</p>
<p>The SaaS model runs on the cloud. The cloud is effectively owned by three companies— Amazon, Microsoft, and, yes, Google. (Four companies if you count Meta, but that&rsquo;s <a href="https://fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/copy-acquire-kill-how-meta-could-pull-off-the-most-extraordinary-pivot-in-tech-history/">another rant</a>).</p>
<p>The big three are spending eye-watering amounts of capex dollars on data centers and reporting growth almost exclusively from cloud services. And that&rsquo;s without ubiquitous AI in all of our subscription software that folks actually want to use.</p>
<p><em>So go ahead</em>, says Google. Be fruitful and multiply those AI features. Open-source it up. We&rsquo;ll even give you the tech for free. Just call us when you launch your app and need that cloud service.</p>
<p>Because why give a shit who sells the milk jars when you own the motherfucking cows, baby!</p>

<p>What if we all just migrate over to the same google doc —@\DJWeduwen, Oct. 2022</p>

<p>It was around then, we all kind of knew Musk would eventually shit the bed. So for a brief moment, some of us migrated to an open Google Doc named NEW TWITTER. It was cool for a bit, then the yatizs arrived, and the doc went read-only.</p>
<p>It goes to show us, it doesn&rsquo;t take much for people to form a commune. Building a little digital community can be simple; sustainable even, so long as it remains small.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the <em>moderation</em> at scale that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Admins who protect their little digital green spaces aren&rsquo;t breaking the tenets of the internet. Those spaces are the manifestation of the web simply by existing. It&rsquo;s the land in which we build on that must remain open for all. Communities should govern according to their means.</p>

			 <p>Threads now lets you transfer your data to Google Drive, except it didn&rsquo;t work, and now Meta has all my Google data.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;feature&rdquo; is presumably part of the <a href="https://dtinit.org/">Data Transfer Initiative</a> funded by Meta and Google. Out of morbid curiosity, I tried it.</p>
<p>On its website, DTI states it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;organization dedicated to the mission of empowering technology users.&rdquo; Cool.</p>
<p>It seems more likely that Big Tech figured out it was better to trade our data amongst themselves, like baseball cards— I&rsquo;ll trade you this pregnancy announcement for that postpartum diagnosis.</p>
<p>Anyway, the first time I tried the transfer, Meta shot an error with a message that it needed more permissions. I granted. The second time, it created an empty folder in my Google Drive. The third time+, it stopped responding.</p>
<p>Why Meta needs to see all my Google Docs, plus the names and contacts of everyone I&rsquo;ve ever shared with, so that I can move some photos is unclear.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel very empowered, tbh.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m listing some blog platform recommendations for a friend, so figured I should just make that list public.</p>
<p><strong>The following are platforms I&rsquo;m familiar with:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>: Simple and loved in the blogging community. I believe it&rsquo;s free with a paid option. If I didn&rsquo;t have a custom site, I&rsquo;d probably use Bear, or Write.as.</p>
<p><a href="https://write.as">Write.as</a>: Also simple and loved. No free version though. Price starts at $6/mo. I used write.as for a few months and enjoyed it.</p>
<p><a href="https://neocities.org/">NeoCities</a>: Nostalgia! I love this concept. I haven&rsquo;t been through the set up process, but it looks like you may need to know some basic HTML/CSS. There&rsquo;s a social element with featured blogs. Service is free with a paid option. Some of my favorite blogs are on NeoCities.</p>
<p><a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>: Feature-rich. Geared toward professional publishers, but anyone can use. If you&rsquo;re just starting out, might be overkill. I used Ghost a few years ago, before its glow-up. It&rsquo;s a great platform. Starts at $9/mo. If you&rsquo;re adventurous, self-hosting a ghost blog is much cheaper.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>: Simple to use but has some cool features. There&rsquo;s also a social element which I like. I use micro.blog daily for sharing interesting links. But long-form works just fine. Starts at $5/mo.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a>: Their blog feature &ldquo;weblog&rdquo; is still in beta. But I&rsquo;m adding them to the list because I love their service so much. It&rsquo;s also sort of difficult to explain. You get your own web address, a linktree-esque webpage, a Mastodon account on their server, plus some other cool stuff for $20/year. Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>A few platforms I&rsquo;m unfamiliar with but looked cool</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.are.na/">Are.na</a>: described as Tumblr meets Wikipedia.</p>
<p><a href="https://posthaven.com/">PostHaven</a>: Up to ten blogs for $5/mo.</p>
<p><a href="https://blot.im/">Blot</a>: Turns a folder into a website.</p>
<p><a href="https://typeshare.co/home">TypeShare</a>: Comes with an idea generator and outliner</p>
<p>A few recommends from the Mastodon community after posting:</p>
<p><em>Note: Some of these perhaps fall on the more technie side and may require some set up.</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://smol.pub/">smol.pub</a>: &ldquo;Your journal on the small net.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://prose.sh/">prose.sh</a>: &ldquo;a blog platform for hackers&rdquo; (hell yeah)</p>
<p><a href="https://mataroa.blog/">mataroa.blog</a>: &ldquo;Naked blogging platform, for minimalists. Just write.&rdquo; (Love)</p>
<p><a href="https://telegra.ph/">telegra.ph</a>: Opens to a blank canvas and a publish button. Nice.</p>
<p><a href="https://pika.page/">pika.page</a>: &ldquo;Pika makes blogging easy and beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s some interesting parallels between the <strong>Technocracy movement</strong> of the 1930s and 40s, and a contemporary movement known as <strong>Effective Altruism</strong>.</p>
<p>Both ideologies promise a techno-utopia, if only we&rsquo;d give the world to its believers.</p>
<p>And both share some lineage— Joshua Norman Haldeman, 1940s director of Technocracy Inc, is the grandfather of Effective Altruism&rsquo;s most powerful evangelist, Elon Musk.</p>
<p>What a gnarly little coincidence.</p>

<p>The Tech Oversight Project decried the change in a statement: “We now know that Mark Zuckerberg and Meta will lie to Congress, endanger the American people, and continually threaten the future of our democracy,” said Kyle Morse, deputy executive director. “This announcement is a horrible preview of what we can expect in 2024.”</p>

<p>Guess which social platform has an outright ban on political ads? I&rsquo;ll give you a hint— it&rsquo;s the only social media platform in US history with bipartisan support to outlaw it.</p>

			 <p>Thinking about a #Meta pivot to infrastructure, and the subtle physiological effects it would have on our social media behavior.</p>
<p>The average user might keep their #Threads account, but signup for other platforms in the #Metaverse as &ldquo;sub-identities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For example— Taylor Swift launches a super fans platform. Would the average Swiftie migrate to the Meta-interoperable space? Or would they make a new account, one that perhaps better represents their fandom identity?</p>

<p>For the new year, I’m sharing my favorite bookmarks of 2023 to my <a href="https://micro.fromjason.xyz">microblog</a>. I will post “blogmixes” as a series of volumes. I don’t know how categorized these will end up, but I plan to post the entire collection on my <a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz">main site</a> towards the end.</p>
<p>As a caveat for the entire BlogMix series, any links I share are because I thought something about the content was interesting, important, wonderful, horrible, or otherwise noteworthy. Including a link does not necessarily mean I agree with a particular message. I considered labeling the links where I don’t agree, but that felt like it took the fun out of the project a bit. We’ll see. This is a new and evolving idea for me.</p>
<p>For this first volume, I included some posts and articles that I’ve either read, rediscovered, or revisited in 2023. I’ll almost certainly do another volume of just posts. Enjoy:</p>

<p>New plan: Each day I&rsquo;ll post a handful of links to my micro. Then, I&rsquo;ll categorize a big list on my main site next week. Is that a better plan? We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>The next major development in email deliverability included the standardization of reputation scores. ‘SenderScore’ and other reputation systems emerged at this time. False positives were further reduced by adding sender authentication mechanisms like Sender Policy Framework, SenderID, and Domainkeys Identified Mail.
Of course, if you&rsquo;re familiar with how these technologies work then you&rsquo;ll notice that most of them are reliant upon centralized gatekeepers who assign IP addresses and control domain registrations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The whole point of ActivityPub as an open protocol is to turn Twitter/Instagram-like social networking into something more akin to email: truly open. If Facebook were on the cusp of launching a Gmail-like email service, would you preemptively declare that your email server would block them? To me that’s what this “Anti-Meta Fedi Pact” is arguing for.</p>

<p>In this scenario, would Facebook&rsquo;s email service receive and catalog every email I send no matter the recipient? #meta</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not about whether Meta can track us across the web. They don&rsquo;t need to the moment we start generating content for them.</p>
<p>Meta has proven time and again that it has no problem with using people&rsquo;s own data to affect their moods and actions.</p>
<p>We can sugar coat it all we want but #Meta has more data on #activitypub users today than it did yesterday.</p>

<p>And, as you might expect, there are hundreds of Catholic Fundamentalism blog posts that would be deeply controversial in most religious circles (“A protestant is a person who willfully disobeys Any Word of Christ” is a doozy). But the way they’re shared on Facebook means that next to no one is actually clicking through to read them. In fact, according to the site’s own traffic counts, <strong>that anti-Protestant post only has 23 views, but its Facebook post has over 7,000 reactions and a thousand comments</strong>. And it&rsquo;s those thousand comments that are the key here.</p>

<p>Weird Christian infighting aside, those figures are wild. I mean, if you told me that 23 people <em>accidentally</em> clicked on his post I&rsquo;d believe you.</p>

<li>Rage bait is a poor way to generate an audience.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>When a tech company designs a device for remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrades, they invite both external and internal parties to demand those downgrades. Like Pavel Chekov says, a phaser on the bridge in Act I is going to go off by Act III. Selling a product that can be remotely, irreversibly, nonconsensually downgraded inevitably results in the worst person at the product-planning meeting proposing to do so. The fact that there are no penalties for doing so makes it impossible for the better people in that meeting to win the ensuing argument, leading to the moral injury of seeing a product you care about reduced to a pile of shit</p>

<p>Great read. We&rsquo;re seeing the worst of SaaS; tech companies becoming so powerful that they can defraud their customers in broad daylight. The worst part is, not a single politician has any interest in regulating the companies they hold stock in.</p>

<p>Yeah, if Apple cared about security, why did they block a company whose entire business model hinged on faking iDevice authenticity? /s</p>

			 <p>From Vice: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxjbv9/apple-just-confirmed-governments-are-spying-on-peoples-phones-with-push-notifications">Apple Just Confirmed Governments Are Spying on People’s Phones With Push Notifications</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process by which push notifications are generated requires the phone company to serve as a “digital post office,” Wyden wrote. Push notifications are sent through Apple and Google&rsquo;s servers, which means that the companies “serve as intermediaries in the transmission process,” and can therefore be made to hand over information to governments that request it.</p>
<p>According to Wyden’s letter, the information that can be gleaned from push notification requests is mostly metadata. This includes information “detailing which app received a notification and when, as well as the phone and associated Apple or Google account to which that notification was intended to be delivered,” Wyden wrote. In some cases, requesters may even receive unencrypted content such as the text that was delivered in the notification.</p>
<p>The senator said that companies can therefore “be secretly compelled by governments to hand over this information.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be so dope if we jumped on stories like this with the same tenacity and vigor as when an iMessage blue bubble story breaks.</p>
<p>Telecom companies are the most user-hostile in the biz.</p>

			 <p>Regarding ad blockers:</p>
<p>The web wasn&rsquo;t always for-profit. In fact, it was decidedly free and open for a time. Most people were content with how the internet was before corporations came and decided to monetize.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not so much an unwillingness to support platforms via ads; it&rsquo;s that some people are simply rejecting in its entirety the forced participation of the for-profit web.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t kill off all the indie platforms and then get mad when people don&rsquo;t fall in line.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, and I know it sounds pedantic. AI isn&rsquo;t taking anything away from anyone. Rich <em>people</em> are taking jobs away from poorer people, in order to enrich themselves further; as the story always goes.</p>
<p>These very wealthy <em>people</em> just happen to be using AI at the moment to accomplish their ongoing fetish for working class suffering.</p>

			 <p>The shift away from the preverbal &ldquo;for you&rdquo;— finite, human-curated— and to towards the explicit &ldquo;For You&rdquo;— endless, algorithm-driven, bespoke— has stripped us of a sort of transparent &ldquo;social authority&rdquo; we once had with the hyperlinked-curated web.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Influencer,&rdquo; &ldquo;thought-leader,&rdquo; etc. are now tainted terms. But we still enjoy recommendations by those with &ldquo;good taste&rdquo; and implicit standards.</p>
<p>In an algorithm-driven web where tastemakers are corporate executives and content discovery is limited to our preferred social media silo, we&rsquo;ve lost the <strong>human curator</strong>.

<p>Human curators are like the missing wolves of Yellowstone— vilified creatures we allowed to be exiled. But, their absence is fucking up our ecosystem. And we know something&rsquo;s off; we talk about it every day.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://ia.net/topics/ia-writer-7">iA Writer 7, my favorite writing app, integrates ChatGPT (sort of)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only person that can safely discern human from artificial text is the person writing. iA Writer now supports making the distinction. There’s no fancy ghost doing this for you. It’s up to you to decide how honest you want to be with yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new version of <strong>iA Writer</strong> ( <em>not</em> AI Writer) will keep track of the text you paste from ChatGPT into the its app. Authorship is displayed at the end of the document. iA calls the new open format <a href="https://github.com/iainc/Markdown-Annotations">Markdown Annotations</a>, and hopes other developers expand on it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I think writers have soured on generative AI. Most won&rsquo;t go near it as a matter of religious conviction, so I wonder which will embrace this compromise. iA Writer is a <em>writer&rsquo;s</em> writer app. There seems to be a strong dichotomy between who uses services like ChatGPT and who doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s opinions on new things do soften over time, however, right? I kind of love that the folks at <a href="https://ia.net/">Information Architects</a> found a way to incorporate AI without minimizing creative efforts.</p>
<p>Of course, you sometimes must declare your pasted text as AI-generated. Pasting from desktop appears to auto-detect from ChatGPT. Most companies like OpenAI and Midjourney don&rsquo;t seem too interested in creating a digital watermark for AI content, which I suspect would help here. It&rsquo;s a problem. <a href="https://fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/madonna-in-the-80s-ai-already-tainting-our-history/">Ask Madonna</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: I titled this post <em>iA Writer 7 keeps you honest</em>, but on further reflection I think it does more than that. I think it gives skittish writers permission to use AI without feeling like a fraud. Our memories aren&rsquo;t always that great. And we sometimes forget to look back at our work with kind eyes. No one wants to read an old post and wonder if some AI prose slipped in. I don&rsquo;t use AI for writing anything other than work outlines. But I can see value in a GPT assistant helping me flush out ideas. The ability to do that and document the process is pretty cool.</p>

<p>I love the way certain styles cluster over time. Or how some aesthetics appear once then disappear, while others maintain an ebb and flow that can span decades.</p>

<p>Pentagram saw an opportunity to turn Snoo into a character as iconic as Super Mario and cement its role as Reddit’s mascot by formalizing its shape and details. This process involved taking the existing 2D Snoo icon and rendering it in 3D, with the kind of nuanced character development that goes into designing Pixar characters. Snoo’s new 3D form—and a new menu of emoji-like Snoos—opens the door for the character’s next act. It also lays the groundwork for a new core illustration style, transitioning from spot illustrations that lack a common thread, to heroic 3D icons, all unified in form.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the industrial firms that Marx and Smith wrote about, tech firms like Google differ in one key aspect: how they turn a profit. Where industrial firms extract profits from the gap between value produced and what workers get paid in wages, internet platforms rely foremost on rents, which generate profit on the basis of existing property, intellectual or otherwise. No additional labor is needed for each unit of output; profit thus becomes fundamentally extractive, or “unproductive” as Marx, or even classical economists like Smith and Ricardo, would say. For companies like Google, rent comes from owning the infrastructure through which we live our digital lives. The vast majority of Google’s windfall profits—$60 billion in 2022—come from rents.</p>

<p>Occasionally, I&rsquo;d like to share a piece from a big publication, like: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a> (1945) by Vannevar Bush for The Atlantic.</p>
<p>Because of all the ads, that page is not a &ldquo;post&rdquo; or an &ldquo;article&rdquo; in fromjason land. It&rsquo;s a piece of revenue-generating content with a degraded reading experience (of no fault of the author, obviously).</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m adding an &ldquo;<strong>adicle</strong>&rdquo; tag for such occasions.</p>
<p>Adicles exist solely to generate ad revenue with no considerations for the reading experience (or substance in many cases). Still, some adicles contain writing worth a share. I&rsquo;ll just be sure to label it what it is: ads with a splash of prose.</p>

			 <p>I wanted my micro.blog bookmarks public and filtered, so I did some digging:</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/sod">@sod</a> has a great <a href="https://github.com/svendahlstrand/plugin-bookmarks-shortcode">public bookmarks plug-in</a>. Effortless setup.</p>
<p>I then stumbled on <a href="https://micro.blog/pratik">@pratik</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://microblog.pratikmhatre.com/2023/08/15/thanks-to-heylouras.html">post</a> sharing their <a href="https://microblog.pratikmhatre.com/faves/">faves page</a>, which led me to <a href="https://micro.blog/heyloura">@heyloura</a>&rsquo;s code to <a href="https://paste.lol/loura/micro-blog-bookmarks-shortcode">filter bookmarks by tag</a>.</p>
<p>I get to work on my bookmarks page today because of their contributions. Hooray for smart and generous people.</p>

<p>Writing is thinking. iA Writer is designed to make thinking enjoyable. A writing app that thinks for you is a robot that does your jogging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What surprised me the most about our new AI-capable world is the expressed disdain for human creators (artists) by &ldquo;AI artists&rdquo; (prompters). There&rsquo;s this attitude that creativity itself has been an injustice to non-creative people. And that AI is here to square that circle.</p>
<p>People who sell art for profit, but cannot experience the joys of creativity, view artistry as a liability. To them, it&rsquo;s nothing more than a supply chain bottleneck. It&rsquo;s manual labor to be automated away.</p>
<p>But of course, the economic efficiencies promised by generative AI isn&rsquo;t enough for them. &ldquo;Prompt artists&rdquo; demand all the creative accolades too. They want the gold medal placed around their necks after their robot finishes the race.</p>

<p>Maybe my favorite internet manifesto. I go back to it often because it&rsquo;s incredibly funny prose. But also, when I&rsquo;m itching to complicate things, I need it to reel me in. Even if it&rsquo;s satire.</p>

<p>I love that the PDF is saved as &ldquo;Nytimes firefox final&rdquo; All these years, and we haven&rsquo;t found a versioning system better than appending &ldquo;final&rdquo; to the file name.</p>

			 <p>Well, cellular-powered Macs. 5G is assumed. Unless they use some other technology.. 👀</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/macbook-integrated-cellular-modem-2028/">MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing in his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman says that Apple&rsquo;s custom technology aspirations include integrating an in-house modem into its system-on-a-chip (SoC), which would eventually see the launch of MacBooks with built-in cellular connectivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a wild conspiracy theory that iPhone&rsquo;s Emergency Satellite service is a precursor to a fully-Apple cellular network. What better way to kick off the new service than with a satellite-connected  MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, I&rsquo;ll be first in line for a Mac I can use without coffee shop WiFi.</p>
