			 <p><a href="https://ia.net/topics/ia-writer-7">iA Writer 7, my favorite writing app, integrates ChatGPT (sort of)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only person that can safely discern human from artificial text is the person writing. iA Writer now supports making the distinction. There’s no fancy ghost doing this for you. It’s up to you to decide how honest you want to be with yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new version of <strong>iA Writer</strong> ( <em>not</em> AI Writer) will keep track of the text you paste from ChatGPT into the its app. Authorship is displayed at the end of the document. iA calls the new open format <a href="https://github.com/iainc/Markdown-Annotations">Markdown Annotations</a>, and hopes other developers expand on it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I think writers have soured on generative AI. Most won&rsquo;t go near it as a matter of religious conviction, so I wonder which will embrace this compromise. iA Writer is a <em>writer&rsquo;s</em> writer app. There seems to be a strong dichotomy between who uses services like ChatGPT and who doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s opinions on new things do soften over time, however, right? I kind of love that the folks at <a href="https://ia.net/">Information Architects</a> found a way to incorporate AI without minimizing creative efforts.</p>
<p>Of course, you sometimes must declare your pasted text as AI-generated. Pasting from desktop appears to auto-detect from ChatGPT. Most companies like OpenAI and Midjourney don&rsquo;t seem too interested in creating a digital watermark for AI content, which I suspect would help here. It&rsquo;s a problem. <a href="https://fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/madonna-in-the-80s-ai-already-tainting-our-history/">Ask Madonna</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: I titled this post <em>iA Writer 7 keeps you honest</em>, but on further reflection I think it does more than that. I think it gives skittish writers permission to use AI without feeling like a fraud. Our memories aren&rsquo;t always that great. And we sometimes forget to look back at our work with kind eyes. No one wants to read an old post and wonder if some AI prose slipped in. I don&rsquo;t use AI for writing anything other than work outlines. But I can see value in a GPT assistant helping me flush out ideas. The ability to do that and document the process is pretty cool.</p>

<p>A few months back, I began bookmarking posts if it mentioned a design style by name. Last night, I stumbled on <a href="https://cari.institute/">CARI</a>— Consumer Aesthetics Research Institute, a design repository that catalogs styles through the years.</p>
<p>I love the way certain styles cluster over time. Or how some aesthetics appear once then disappear, while others maintain an ebb and flow that can span decades.</p>
<p>Frutiger Aero has seen a resergence in interest (or so it seems, I learned the proper name for the aesthetic just last year). I wonder if it&rsquo;ll make a comeback.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you need a rabbit hole, this should kill a couple hours. Good stuff.</p>

<p>Pentagram saw an opportunity to turn Snoo into a character as iconic as Super Mario and cement its role as Reddit’s mascot by formalizing its shape and details. This process involved taking the existing 2D Snoo icon and rendering it in 3D, with the kind of nuanced character development that goes into designing Pixar characters. Snoo’s new 3D form—and a new menu of emoji-like Snoos—opens the door for the character’s next act. It also lays the groundwork for a new core illustration style, transitioning from spot illustrations that lack a common thread, to heroic 3D icons, all unified in form.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the industrial firms that Marx and Smith wrote about, tech firms like Google differ in one key aspect: how they turn a profit. Where industrial firms extract profits from the gap between value produced and what workers get paid in wages, internet platforms rely foremost on rents, which generate profit on the basis of existing property, intellectual or otherwise. No additional labor is needed for each unit of output; profit thus becomes fundamentally extractive, or “unproductive” as Marx, or even classical economists like Smith and Ricardo, would say. For companies like Google, rent comes from owning the infrastructure through which we live our digital lives. The vast majority of Google’s windfall profits—$60 billion in 2022—come from rents.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m using defined tags to filter my public bookmarks. Posts with lots of ads will be tagged as &ldquo;<strong>adicles</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;posts&rdquo; tag is exclusive to personal &ldquo;sites.&rdquo; &ldquo;Articles&rdquo; come from &ldquo;orgs&rdquo; and &ldquo;agencies,&rdquo; so forth, and so on.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I&rsquo;d like to share a piece from a big publication, like: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a> (1945) by Vannevar Bush for The Atlantic.</p>
<p>Because of all the ads, that page is not a &ldquo;post&rdquo; or an &ldquo;article&rdquo; in fromjason land. It&rsquo;s a piece of revenue-generating content with a degraded reading experience (of no fault of the author, obviously).</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m adding an &ldquo;<strong>adicle</strong>&rdquo; tag for such occasions.</p>
<p>Adicles exist solely to generate ad revenue with no considerations for the reading experience (or substance in many cases). Still, some adicles contain writing worth a share. I&rsquo;ll just be sure to label it what it is: ads with a splash of prose.</p>

<p>What surprised me the most about our new AI-capable world is the expressed disdain for human creators (artists) by &ldquo;AI artists&rdquo; (prompters). There&rsquo;s this attitude that creativity itself has been an injustice to non-creative people. And that AI is here to square that circle.</p>
<p>People who sell art for profit, but cannot experience the joys of creativity, view artistry as a liability. To them, it&rsquo;s nothing more than a supply chain bottleneck. It&rsquo;s manual labor to be automated away.</p>
<p>But of course, the economic efficiencies promised by generative AI isn&rsquo;t enough for them. &ldquo;Prompt artists&rdquo; demand all the creative accolades too. They want the gold medal placed around their necks after their robot finishes the race.</p>

			 <p>Increasingly fascinated by boutique search engines like <a href="https://search.marginalia.nu/">Marginalia</a>.</p>
<p>Because when was the last at time you searched on Google and didn&rsquo;t land on a website rife with ads? Have you <em>ever</em> clicked on a Google search result, and it was just some dude&rsquo;s site where they write about a topic you&rsquo;re interested in?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a whole other internet out there that Google won&rsquo;t show us because it doesn&rsquo;t make money from it.</p>

			 <p>Well, cellular-powered Macs. 5G is assumed. Unless they use some other technology.. 👀</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/macbook-integrated-cellular-modem-2028/">MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing in his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman says that Apple&rsquo;s custom technology aspirations include integrating an in-house modem into its system-on-a-chip (SoC), which would eventually see the launch of MacBooks with built-in cellular connectivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a wild conspiracy theory that iPhone&rsquo;s Emergency Satellite service is a precursor to a fully-Apple cellular network. What better way to kick off the new service than with a satellite-connected  MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, I&rsquo;ll be first in line for a Mac I can use without coffee shop WiFi.</p>

			 <p>Thinking of ways my micro blog can complement my main site.</p>
<p>One idea I like is to use my micro blog link as a &ldquo;link tree&rdquo; for my social. Was going to make a page like that anyway. Now I have the added benefit of realtime posts too.</p>

			 <p>This is an experiment. Frmjsn is a way to enjoy the abilities of dynamic content while keeping my main site, <a href="https://fromjason.xyz">fromjason.xyz</a>, static and light.</p>
<p>I chose micro.blog for frmjsn because I like their mission and the platform tools are robust. Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
