<p>Big tech&rsquo;s centralized social networks remain vital for activism and organizing (meet people where they are, and that&rsquo;s where they currently are)</p>

<p>This is a great post all around. I&rsquo;m still grappling with the idea of &ldquo;meeting people where they&rsquo;re at.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve deleted most of my corporate social media. But now it feels like I&rsquo;m preaching to the choir.</p>

<p>This is rad. I&rsquo;m glad this guide exists. But, I also wonder why journalists need to be told that they shouldn&rsquo;t just repeat press release statements from cops and surveillance tech companies. Are we okay?</p>

<p>The last person to pull this “the world is in peril, I&rsquo;m leaving” resignation stunt was Geoffrey Hinton from Google. He now works for an AI academic non-profit funded by Google. Sort of like a weird golden parachute?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Enforcement by sending tech companies legal requests for the names, email addresses, telephone numbers and other identifying data behind social media accounts that track or criticize the agency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The timing of all this doesn&rsquo;t look great for Bluesky and Mike Masnic. Bluesky, the <em>Public Good Corporation</em>, <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/12-16-2025-find-friends">launches</a> “Find Your Friends” in December 2025.</p>
<p>Then, ICE joins Bluesky, the <em>decentralized social media platform</em>, a month later. Bluesky <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/20/ice-becomes-one-of-the-most-blocked-accounts-on-bluesky-after-its-verification/">verifies</a> ICE, which triggers a mass-blocking by Bluesky members. ICE is now the<a href="https://clearsky.app/"> third most blocked account</a> on Bluesky.</p>
<p>DHS now has a public list of everyone who blocked ICE. Not to mention the firehose of everyone&rsquo;s activity data. But don&rsquo;t worry, DHS <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/bluesky-privacy-policy-and-notice">super duper promises</a> it won&rsquo;t collect the personal information of Bluesky&rsquo;s users in a special Bluesky-specific privacy policy.</p>
<p>Why is DHS going out of its way to  reassure Bluesky&rsquo;s user-base by carving out a special privacy policy? What does ICE give a shit about Bluesky&rsquo;s public relations?</p>
<p>And Bluesky&rsquo;s response? Nothing. Because you can&rsquo;t be accountable for people&rsquo;s private data if you kill the concept of privacy.</p>

			 <p>Substack <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/on/p/substack-is-your-corner-of-the-internet">released a new feature</a> that allows writers to customize their Substack page using an HTML/CSS editor, so that their custom design shows up in the Substack app.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.fromjason.xyz/2024/12/22/feature-chum-you.html">feature chum</a>. It&rsquo;s just another way to keep us tethered to the Substack platform; to &ldquo;the cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Internet-of-things (IoT) marked the first crack in my rose-colored glasses in which I viewed big California tech companies. It was the first time I was like, <em>wait a minute.</em> This isn&rsquo;t about giving us something useful. It&rsquo;s about something else (I have that same feeling about AI).</p>
<p>The internet-of-things and Substack&rsquo;s new feature (and AI and blockchain, and crypto, and&ndash;) are related in that they are catalysts for big tech&rsquo;s cloud strategy. It&rsquo;s spaghetti thrown at the wall. Some of the pasta stuck, some slid down to a heaping pile of dead hype.</p>
<p>The sync-and-share business model was pioneered by Dropbox and went mainstream with iCloud. I pay them to keep my MacBook, iPhone and iPad synced and up-to-date. They ensure I don&rsquo;t lose my files.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a good service. I use it to swap writing on my phone to my laptop to my phone again. What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>But, of course, it wasn&rsquo;t enough for big tech. My little ten or so bucks per month isn&rsquo;t buying anyone a second yacht.</p>
<p>A decade ago, sync-and-share revealed what is now the end game for technocrats— 1. Build and enforce that tether from device to data center by any means possible. 2. Get us addicted to remote computational power 3. Dial up the egress fees to 11. Then, voilà. We got the Comcast(s) of compute.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re still hovering around step 2. Flirting with 3.</p>
<p>Reduce the things you do that strengthens that tether.</p>

			 <p><em>The rambling below is a placeholder potentially for a more thoughtful review.</em></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I bought the Tangzu Wan&rsquo;er earbuds because I was curious how they sound. I needed a cheap pair of wired buds, and these were recommended by Snazzy Labs.</p>
<p>The audio sounds terrible. It&rsquo;s like listening through a tin can. I messed with the EQ and still, really poor quality. But there&rsquo;s a caveat.</p>
<p>I think the adapter I had to use because I have an iPhone (RIP headphone jack), isn&rsquo;t working properly and that could be causing the audio to sound like shit.</p>
<p>Anyway, twenty-five bucks or so for these &ldquo;chi-fi&rdquo; earbuds is, I guess, not a bad deal. I&rsquo;m hoping they sound better plugged into a device directly.</p>

			 <p>🎶 <strong>Listening to</strong>: <em><a href="https://youtu.be/eIgK1nIK9Xs">The Same Love That Made Me Laugh</a></em> by Bill Withers</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something cathartic about Bill&rsquo;s music. It&rsquo;s the feeling after a deep sob. It&rsquo;s the smell of rain. It&rsquo;s plopping onto your bed for the first time since morning, and a cool pillow greets your cheek.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to fall into the old man&rsquo;s trap and say “today&rsquo;s music sucks,” because it doesn&rsquo;t. <em><a href="https://youtu.be/i79Gly1ZM5w">Chappell Roan</a></em>, <em><a href="https://youtu.be/ehN265du4W0">Nemahsis</a></em>, <em><a href="https://youtu.be/WAifgn2Cvo8">Sam Fender</a></em>, <em><a href="https://youtu.be/zI383uEwA6Q">Kendrick Lamar</a></em>—all modern classics, imo.</p>
<p>But there really was something special about the 60s and 70s.</p>
<p><em>PS: you really should <a href="https://youtu.be/VsqYlmf3SAg">check out Nemahsis</a>. She&rsquo;s a Palestinian artist and her music is wonderful. She was dropped from her label after October 7th, but decided to complete her album anyway. I&rsquo;m so happy she did because it&rsquo;s a masterpiece. Truly..</em></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I believe there are political event horizons in our history—moments where our actions, or inactions, help or hinder our chances for real systemic change.</p>
<p>After Sandy Hook, when we didn&rsquo;t burn it all to the ground (metaphorically speaking), we made gun reform all but impossible. Politicians now know there is nothing too horrendous that we&rsquo;d (metaphorically) burn down a (hypothetical) Wendy&rsquo;s about it. After George Floyd&rsquo;s murder, when we stopped marching because they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter_Plaza">painted a street</a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/the-embarrassment-of-democrats-wearing-kente-cloth-stoles">cosplayed</a> the Black diaspora, they knew we weren&rsquo;t serious about defunding the police. And they were right after all.</p>
<p>This is that moment for ICE. If, even now, after the viral murder of Renee Nicole Good, our political and cultural leaders aren&rsquo;t compelled to say the thing, then it&rsquo;s a wrap.</p>
<p>Say the thing.</p>
<p>In the last week, I’ve seen lots of famously left-of-center white dudes getting real long in the tooth towards ICE suddenly. It has been surprising, but I love to see it. The only problem is, all of them have stopped short of saying the thing.</p>
<p>So, come on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2026/jan/09/stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel-ice-shooting-minnesota">Stephen Colbert</a>. Let&rsquo;s get it poppin' <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2026/01/lets_call_a_murder_a_murder">John Gruber</a>. Say the thing. Finish the damn job.</p>
<p>Because if it&rsquo;s unjustified death that riles you up, boy, do we have some catching up to do. Imagine if we learned that at <em>least</em> 70 white people <a href="https://americanoversight.org/resource/deadly-failures-preventable-deaths-in-u-s-immigration-detention/">died in detention</a>, or that they were <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/09/15/hysterectomies-ice-irwin-whistleblower/">issued forced sterilizations</a>. There&rsquo;d be riots in the Hamptons. If Mike Masnick can <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2026/01/08/abolish-ice-before-they-kill-again-impeach-trump-noem-before-they-incite-more-murder/">say it</a> (finally) so can you.</p>
<p>Say the thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a faction of the left who measures their intelligence by how reasonable they think they sound. The thought of being labeled frantic or unreasonable by their peers is so horrific that they&rsquo;d sooner let the world burn before admitting we need radical change to put out the fire.</p>
<p>Even when they can bring themselves to call for meaningful change, they still must be wishy-washy about it. Even when it makes no sense.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>maybe an unpopular position on this website but i think the moderate dem focus on ICE training can be, with political pressure, the pathway to more fundamental reforms. rhetorically it is not too hard to move from &ldquo;more training&rdquo; to &ldquo;turns out they&rsquo;re untrainable and we have to start all over.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— jamelle @jamellebouie.net (bsky)</p>
<p>Jamelle understands what we must advocate for in this moment. He&rsquo;s said as much. But like so many of his liberal academic peers, he can&rsquo;t help but over intellectualize the problem, beating it until he achieves magical thinking.</p>
<p>Offering yet another concession to centrists in hopes that they finally see the light is silly. This has been going on for decades. The walk from &ldquo;more training&rdquo; to &ldquo;turns out they&rsquo;re untrainable&rdquo; has proven over and over again too far for centrists.</p>
<p>Even if Jamelle has a valid point, why bring this up now, when people are looking for a little solidarity and certainty? Why martyr yourself on Bluesky?</p>
<p>Maybe what we need right now is less punditry and nuance, and more fight. We need the liberals with microphones to finally stand up <em>for</em> something, and not just against someone.</p>
<p>In the last decade, we’ve focused too heavily on the presence of one man. So that when he left, we had nothing left to object.</p>
<p>Yet, the infrastructure of fascism remained. Since 2020, ICE has grown in scope and authority. We’ve seen over <a href="https://wagingnonviolence.org/2024/09/the-quiet-rollout-of-cop-cities-across-the-us-meets-a-growing-resistance/">eighty new militarized police bases</a> break ground across the country. Because we bought into the lie that Trump was the root cause of the horrors we witnessed, a newly elected Biden was free to pass record-breaking budgets for the military industrial complex.</p>
<p>So, clearly, Democrats are not against fascist systems. They are against Trump&rsquo;s access to them. And left-of-center liberals are not against the cogs of an ethnic cleansing, so long as they maintain control of the levers.</p>
<p>How lucky would we be if Trump had to start from a defunded DHS? But instead, we got the most productive 100 days of any president in recent history. We would not be where we are now if Democrats fought against the corporatization of our government, and the militarization of our police. To be clear, I&rsquo;m not saying they tried and failed. Dems are largely pro-police state, pro-surveillance state and surveillance capitalism. That is a fact.</p>
<p>Militarized police bases, war-trained cops, record-breaking police budgets—all happened under the Biden administration. Trump doesn&rsquo;t build weapons of fascism. He doesn&rsquo;t build anything. Like all his failed businesses, he&rsquo;s using what others have built and slaps his logo on it. So none of this ICE shit happens the way it is happening without the infrastructure built by his predecessors.</p>
<p>Now, the day Trump makes his final exit (that day can&rsquo;t come soon enough), we’ll go right back to funding the dictator’s toolkit, assuming a dictator won’t ever get their hands on it again. When he inevitably does, we&rsquo;ll act as if he built these systems from thin air.</p>
<p>I get things are objectively scarier than a year ago. I&rsquo;m not saying Biden is as bad as Trump. Nor Democrats as bad as Republicans. What I am saying is, a big part of why Trump gets to be so scary is because we, on the left, don&rsquo;t want to admit to ourselves that our preferred politicians put us in this predicament. We can acknowledge that militarized police are terrorizing the marginalized, but no one wants to ask why we have cops with tanks and the power to use them in the first place.</p>
<p>After George Floyd&rsquo;s murder, liberals demanded reform, some even called for defunding. But we ended the conversation once we got back our plausible deniability from the American press; the day they stopped talking about it, and we stopped having to acknowledge it. As time went on, when the images of a man taking another man’s life were no longer fresh in our minds, we outright rejected the only viable solution for ending police brutality. And we did it in the name of centrist solidarity.</p>
<p>Liberals who declared the Defund the Police movement as &ldquo;political poison,&rdquo; do so as if they&rsquo;re not the ones who get to decided if defunding police brutality is a worthy pursuit. So often, Liberals will play the role of political saboteur, then swap hats to become the political pundit observing their own undermining.</p>
<p>Say the thing.</p>
<p>A majority of Americans <a href="https://micro.fromjason.xyz/2026/01/13/more-people-want-to-abolish.html">now support</a> the abolishment of ICE. This is no longer a radical stance. But, people with the biggest microphones aren&rsquo;t saying the thing. I love a good <a href="https://youtu.be/eZ1XUsf8l1c?si=w1IsT_YkSurNOgIq">pithy monologue</a>. But if it doesn&rsquo;t end with &ldquo;abolish ice, fade to black,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re wasting our fucking time, man.</p>
<p>Say the thing. Abolish ICE.</p>

			 <p>In my iPhone settings, I stumbled across a list of apps Apple says “are signed in to your Apple Music account and can access your music activity and media library.” The problem is, I don&rsquo;t remember giving permission.</p>
<p>A couple of these names I recognize—Bands in Town, and Houdini. But, when did I give UGM Microservice access to my AM account? And who is “This promoter?”</p>
<p>In fact, who the fuck are any of these nodes with unfettered access to my music library and listening habits? What the fuck, Apple?</p>
<p>A quick google search results in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/u78bvx/any_idea_what_this_promoter_and_umg_microservice/#lightbox">Reddit thread</a> inquiring about the mysterious apps, along with <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254525212">this</a> and <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255704455">this</a> Apple Support forum page, with people asking the same question.</p>
<p>The two forum posts do not offer any answers. The first post from January 2023 has a response, but the question “What are they?” is ignored. The second post from August 2024, which asks a more direct question, is left unanswered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what are these apps and what purpose do they serve?:
Apple Media Web Player
Apollo Dev
Linkfire
This promoter
UMG Microservice</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reddit thread led me to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/28/pre-saving-music-online-can-cost-you-privacy-report-says">six year old article</a> from The Guardian:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To pre-save a new Little Mix single, for instance, users were asked to give Sony Music 17 permissions, including the continuous ability to view their entire library, what music they’re playing, and the device they’re playing it on, as well as their email address and who they follow on the device.</p>
<p>Only one permission, to “add and remove items in Your Library”, is actually needed to pre-save an item.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve definitely pre-saved albums on Apple Music before. But I think I&rsquo;d remember granting UGM unrestricted access to my account for all eternity. Or, did Apple save me the hassle and granted the access on my behalf?</p>
<p>I deleted all but &ldquo;Apple Music, Podcasts, and TV Web Player&rdquo; and “MusicKit”. I have no idea if either of those are important or not.</p>
<p><em>On your iPhone, go to your Apple Music app &gt; Profile photo &gt; Account Settings &gt; Account Access &gt; Apple Music</em></p>
<p>Anyway. Gotta love that Apple Privacy™.</p>

In Brooklyn, Miami, Chicago, and the Midwest, I keep seeing the same thing: the people keeping their communities informed aren’t reporters. They’re the pastor who delivers immigration updates before the sermon. The barber who streams local politics on Facebook Live. The neighbor who translates every school notice and distributes it through five different group chats. The teacher who explains American bureaucracy to families who arrived last week. The WhatsApp moderator running a rumor-control operation that outperforms the mayor’s office.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know many people who, if I shared this article with them, would get nervous. It comes from a decade of disinformation campaigns by people claiming to be independent journalists. Fair.</p>
<p>But this is our reality. American newsrooms have fail us. Regular folks are filling the gaps. And I think they&rsquo;re doing a good job, more often than not.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shorter walk from inexperienced to experienced journalist, than it is from corporate mouthpiece to independent voice.</p>

			 <p>I think the reason it&rsquo;s so hard to garner empathy for the poor is because so many Americans believe they are a rags-to-richest success story, that they pulled themselves up by their boot straps. It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;poverty is in the eyes of the beholder&rdquo; type situation.</p>

<p>Ken has done some incredible work, so nothing against him. But, he right.</p>
<p>There is a thin line between news and soap opera, both in how it’s delivered and how it&rsquo;s consumed.</p>
<p>We are all way too involved in the political intrigue—endless court documents, political rivalries, made-for-tv espionage.</p>
<p>They drop another carcass of scandalous photos, we devour them in the comment sections of our favorite political influencers, and when the bones are picked clean, it’s on to the next scandal.</p>
<p>It’s actually remarkable. There’s noting in history that compares to the American political soap opera.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s greatest achievement, his magnum opus, is the reality tv show he’s produced over the last decade. And we are all avid watchers.</p>

			 <h1 id="the-tragic-life-of-a-content-creator-late-2023">The tragic life of a content creator (late 2023)</h1>
<p>Today I deleted my TikTok account. I had 57,000 followers, and 1.3mm likes. I published over one thousand videos over four years. I collected $430 from the TikTok creator fund. I made three friends.</p>
<p>Influencers do not typically speak out on atrocities because they have traded agency for celebrity. There are rules. And when you break the rules there are consequences.</p>
<p>When we decide to pursue Internet celebrity, we are making a choice consciously or subconsciously that it is better to try to rise above an unjust system then try to help fix it.</p>
<p>And with that choice, we offer up our agency in hopes we are gifted exemption from the trappings of everyday capitalism.</p>
<p>Those of us unlucky enough to be chosen as an influencer have a clear responsibility.</p>
<p>Influencers are agents of the spectacle. Their jobs are to occupy attention. Nothing more. Nothing less.</p>
<p>In exchange, Influencers are allowed to rent opulence, and escape the drudgery of the contemporary 9-to-5.</p>
<p>But, of course, there are some rules.</p>
<p>Rule 1:</p>
<p>At all times you are to play the role that the algorithm has assigned you. That role will be the version of yourself that is most marketable to the masses. Even in tears you are selling macchiatos. So keep it light.</p>
<p>Rule 2:</p>
<p>Even and especially while you are still in poverty, you must imply that you are paid well by documenting your adjacency to the elite class. When you do make money, if ever, you must spend it on the façade of wealth. No saving.</p>
<p>And most important of all,</p>
<p>Rule 3:</p>
<p>You can bear witness to suffering so long as you never identify a culprit. Or criticize the system that gifted you your pseudo celebrity status.</p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s where it gets tricky.</p>
<p>The consequence for breaking these rules is algorithmic exile or worse. But as the system ramps up its extraction, your target audiences, those that have gifted you your platform, will experience unrest and suffering. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll seek out the cause of their pain by identifying those on their FYP who have not acknowledged it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in these moments that the influencer realizes the trap.</p>
<p>The smart ones foresee this trap and start early. They wrap their influence in conciliatory philanthropy that holds no opinion on why such charity must exist in the first place.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a noncontentious way to perform activism without ever having to challenge the system. And in times of peace, these charitable acts will strengthen the influencer&rsquo;s celebrity.</p>
<p>But inevitably the system will do something so heinous. so horrid. That even the most aloof pacifist will begin to demand activism from the influencer they&rsquo;ve invested in.</p>
<p>And this is the Catch-22 for the influencer. If they break rule three, they risk algorithmic exile, which is basically a career death sentence. If they stay quiet, their audiences may turn on them.</p>
<p>Of course, neither outcome holds any consequence to the algorithm because there&rsquo;s always someone waiting in the wings to replace a fallen influencer.</p>
<p>Many will wisely ignore our cries in hopes it goes away. Often times things do settle down. People forget. Long term grief makes for short term memory.</p>
<p>￼Some will speak out in haste, deftly maneuvering through their monetized videos, offering a concessed acknowledgement of suffering without ever calling it out by name.</p>
<p>Go back and watch your favorite influencers. The ones who caved to pressure to speak on Palestine. Which words could they not bring themselves to say?</p>
<p>In many ways, the influencer has less freedom then their cubical dwelling counterparts.</p>
<p>But by the time they realize what they have become, it is too late.</p>
<p>Influencers are gladiators. The spectacle is watching them fight for their freedom in the social media arena. It is we as the audience who gives the proverbial thumbs up or thumbs down.</p>

			 <p><em>This is the beginnings of an essay I wrote then forgot about. I have a lot of those. So much has changed since I wrote this in 2023-ish. It doesn&rsquo;t seem as relevant. Anyway, enjoy this half baked essay about how weird it once felt to scroll Threads. Haven&rsquo;t been back much. I wonder if it still feels that way?</em></p>
<p>It’s difficult to write about Threads without sounding conspiritorial, because the app&rsquo;s vibe <em>feels</em> like a conspiracy. If the so-called social web is in transition, then Threads, Mark Zuckerberg’s latest microblogging platform, is the hallway connecting the yesterweb to some unsettled (and unsettling) future. The feeling is palpable. There’s something uncanny about the platform. It’s precursory. It’s liminal.</p>
<p>Scrolling through the timeline, there’s a sense that what you are seeing is fabricated; that the timeline isn’t governed by popularity, or engagement, even.</p>
<p>Walking through a fabricated Disney Pavillion, like what you’d see in Epcot, offers a wonderful excuse to suspend your disbelief. <em>Let the wonders of Tuscany consume your senses!</em></p>
<p>Mickey Mouse is not just a character stuck behind a TV screen, he&rsquo;s your friend. Go up to him and say hi! Every cast member, every detail, every nook and cranny is deliberately crafted to provide us with a magical experience. Its all in good capitalistic fun. We can ignore the fact that what we’re actually strolling through is an elaboratly crafted Walmart.</p>
<p>But what makes Disney World different than, say, the boomtowns of the Wild West, is that we&rsquo;re in on the show. We enjoy Epcot because people are pretending with us, not at us.</p>
<p>There’s a thin line between wonder and surreality. Walk through that same Disney pavilion, but this time with the expectation that you are <em>actually</em> in Central Italy, things start feeling eerie. The architecture <em>looks</em> Venetian. In the distance, the backdrop <em>resembles</em> a mountain range. And that wine in a plastic cup you bought in the piazza, well, it <em>is</em> red, I guess. (Sure hope it doesn’t unexpectedly gush out of an elevator at me.)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what it feels like to scroll through the Threads app. Like, if we were able to peek behind its structure we&rsquo;d discover the two-by-four planks propping up a Potemkin Village.</p>
<p>I thought I might be alone in this experience. But it turns out, others have this unshakable feeling that Threads is somehow not real.</p>
<p><em>(I remember having screen shots of threads posts to put here but I can&rsquo;t find them anymore. If I do, I&rsquo;ll update.)</em></p>
<p>Viral trends seem robotic. Popular posts feel synthetic. And by the time you hop off the app, the taste in your mouth is metallic.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something off about threads.net.</p>

		<a href="https://micro.fromjason.xyz/2025/12/16/every-story-is-a-moral.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-12-16 15:45:20 -0400">Dec 16, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I keep thinking about the idea that all stories have a moral (or several) and whether or not you consume media through a critical lens, those morals tend to stick around in our subconscious.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not conscious of every moral that lives within us. Particularly if that moral was formed by a movie, or tv show, etc. These are our little narratives that help guide our lives even if we don&rsquo;t know they exist.</p>
<p>So, if you see a Puerto Rican robbing someone in a movie, maybe you form a little narrative about that, and maybe, if there isn&rsquo;t a moral to counteract that, like a Puerto Rican playing a CEO in the next movie you watch, that little narrative gets a little long in the tooth behind your back.</p>
<p>American media have gotten slightly better at fixing these representations. <em>Slightly</em>. Though, it&rsquo;s not perfect, and it does not mean to undo the narratives already formed. I fear that Puerto Rican CEO in the woke remake of <em>All Puerto Ricans Are Criminals</em> might register as an anomaly, and not as a clear challenger to the rooted narrative. This movie doesn&rsquo;t exist, by the way. Just in case you thought you had a new Letterboxd review in waiting. I&rsquo;m just ranting and too lazy to research a good example.</p>
<p>The moral to <em>this</em> story is (nothing, it&rsquo;s a rant remember?), we all work from unconscious narratives. Some benign, some harmful. Our media may be a reflection of us, but we look to media for a baseline of cultural norm. And so, these little narratives bounce back and forth, validating themselves.</p>
<p>We may think to ourselves, <em>I&rsquo;m not racist</em>. And that may be true in a I-don&rsquo;t-burn-crosses sort of way (because that&rsquo;s what our media say racism looks like). But it doesn&rsquo;t mean we are free from the racist morals we collect as a result of our media consumption. And because those morals form narratives without our consent, it&rsquo;s our job to, every once in a while, dig around for those narratives so that we may challenge them.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the fun part: those narratives surface anyway, no matter how niche. Most of the time, it&rsquo;s useful for our decision making. But sometimes, we learn in public that some of those narratives are <em>real fucking racist</em> and everyone around us now knows it too. Better to challenge them in private, on our own terms.</p>

<p>TESCREALism — meaning the worldview that arises from this bundle — is simple enough: at its heart is a techno-utopian vision of the future in which we re-engineer humanity, colonize space, plunder the cosmos, and establish a sprawling intergalactic civilization full of trillions and trillions of “happy” people, nearly all of them “living” inside enormous computer simulations. In the process, all our problems will be solved, and eternal life will become a real possibility.</p>

<p>Leading AI companies are increasingly advocating for government regulation that would constrain their competitors while preserving their market advantages.

			 <p>After writing <a href="https://fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/hank-green-and-the-fantastical-tales-of-god-ais/">Hank Green And The Fantastical Tales of God AIs</a> and watching a lot of tech related videos on his channel, I noticed something odd: I can&rsquo;t find a single video where Hank Green has platformed, or even spoken about, a non-white male in the tech discourse.</p>
<p>This may not be such a big deal if Hank wasn&rsquo;t platforming people like Nate Soares, or if Hank didn&rsquo;t speak about tech and AI as much as he does.</p>
<p>In the past two or there years, there&rsquo;s been a flood of great books, essays, and studies about the tech industry—harms caused, strategies revealed, etc, by non-white males. So much so, that I made a quick list just from memory.</p>
<p>When you look at Hank&rsquo;s peers, someone like Adam Conover, you see a lot of these names and faces below because these people have worked the YouTube channel circuit.</p>
<p>But I can&rsquo;t find one example of any women, Black or brown folks in tech that Hank&rsquo;s platformed, or even mentioned. I&rsquo;m <em>sure</em> there&rsquo;s at least a few examples in the past few years. Right?</p>

			 <p>For two decades, Silicon Valley&rsquo;s strategy has been to subsidize massive losses in order to obliterate the market and become a monopoly i.e. Amazon, Uber, etc.</p>
<p>Now, China is doing the exact same thing with <em>every</em> market, and the US cannot do anything about it because regulating this type of strategy would necessarily also target US tech companies, making them slightly less powerful.</p>
<p>The American people, particularly the working class who&rsquo;ve been exploited the most by big tech, couldn&rsquo;t care less because they&rsquo;ve been completely excluded from the wealth generated over the past twenty+ years. So to them, the cheap, direct-to-consumer products and digital tools coming from China is a welcomed financial releif.</p>

<p>So then why is Meta spending $80 billion in GPUs and data centers for 2025? Could it be that AI is a fucking scam?</p>

<p>In such a scenario, a smaller company would buy the Tiktok &ldquo;brand&rdquo; and front end. Meta would then have exclusive rights to provide the cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>On paper, it would look like the smaller company owns TikTok, but effectively it&rsquo;s Meta.</p>

<p>Maybe this is an obvious detail, but I hadn&rsquo;t noticed before. For the entire film, detectives Summerset and Mills sludge through damp darkness searching for the truth. It&rsquo;s not until the third and final act that we ever see the sun. And in that last minute, the truth is revealed in a dark and damp box.</p>
<p>I also noticed how Fincher used themes of beginnings and endings as a sort of misdirect. I don&rsquo;t recall how I thought Seven would end when I first saw the movie, but if I had to guess, I&rsquo;d say it was Summerset who&rsquo;d be killed—the old detective days from retiring. What made the ending so stunning, other than the obvious, was that it was the new detective with the new wife and child who fell victim to John Doe.</p>

			 <p>I have a prediction for 2025 that I think is inevitable:</p>
<p>Big media conglomerates will start acquiring publishing platforms like Substack. Indie journalists who&rsquo;ve strayed too far from the trad-media script will be deprioritized in the platforms’ recommendation engines.</p>
<p>People will cry fowl but there won&rsquo;t be much anyone (in the US) can do about it. I can even see some legislation passed to help these acquisitions in some way. Assuming the media can sweet-talk the President enough to avoid a veto.</p>
<p>Edit: Looks like Elon <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-twitter-substack-x-1987589">tried purchasing Substack</a> back in 2023 according  to a recent report. 😅</p>

dollars in some cases. Allegedly, these theatres counted unpaid actors and staff as full-time paid employees.</p>
<p>As someone dialed into the Atlanta theatre scene in 2020, I remember how many actors, comedians, and stage workers struggled to meet their basic needs during the pandemic. I&rsquo;m sure none of the Atlanta-based theatres were this dishonest, but I hope the media look into this so people can know the truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>FUTURISM, initiated with the publication of Marinetti&rsquo;s Manifesto of Futurism in 1909, was the most aggressive and, if short-lived, certainly the most polemic art movement of our time. Its revolutionary ideas were empiric rather than pedagogic and were filled with iconoclasm in its defiant repudiation of traditional art, supplanting idols of the past with the machine of the present.</p>

And they often had Spotify’s verified-artist badge. But they were clearly fake.

<p>PayPal, YouTube, TikTok, and Meta have all banned the provocative clothing company <a href="https://www.comradeworkwear.com/">Comrade Workwear</a>. Presumably, the bans are a response to the company revealing a playing card set with pictures of American CEOs.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Each card has a picture of a CEO with a QR code that takes you to a webpage with a bio explaining why that CEO is evil. On the back side of the card is a silhouette associated with shooting range targets.</p>
<p><img src="https://micro.fromjason.xyz/uploads/2024/43e73d78b9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unclear if the cards ever went up for sale. Most of the videos I&rsquo;ve found <a href="https://x.com/ImMeme0/status/1868350045046919269">of the guy describing the cards</a> are from far-right accounts, so I apologize that I don&rsquo;t have a better link to share.</p>
<p>Is this set of cards crass? Sure. It&rsquo;s not something I would buy, personally. But how many times have these big tech companies pulled the free speech, uh, card when it&rsquo;s time to ban some Nazis?</p>
<p><em>Update 12/25/2024</em>: Found Comrade Workwear&rsquo;s back-up TikTok account.</p>

			 <p>In cold blood.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read that phrase more in the last two weeks than perhaps in my lifetime. So much so that I lost its meaning and needed to look it up.</p>
<p>To say someone was killed “in cold blood” means it was done without emotion, in a calculated manner. I can&rsquo;t think of anything more emotionless and calculating than budgeting death for faceless shareholders. Can you?</p>
<p>US healthcare executives kill thousands of Americans each year <strong>in cold blood</strong>.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/s/AJTRoarO3k">Apple AI isn&rsquo;t very good (r/apple)</a></p>
<p>The most reasonable answer is that Apple is simply behind in the AI arms race. However, a part of me wonders if Apple executives are purposely tanking Apple Intelligence to mold public perceptions that AI is a trash technology. Apple certainly has the influence and the reach to shape this narrative, and AI isn&rsquo;t a part of Apple&rsquo;s core business model.</p>
<p>AI is what I call “<a href="https://micro.fromjason.xyz/2024/12/22/feature-chum-you.html">feature chum</a>”— corporate power grabs disguised as valuable user features. AI requires large amounts of compute. Compute is expensive and won&rsquo;t be subsidized forever. <a href="https://www.eidosmedia.com/updater/technology/How-Competitive-is-Cloud-Computing#contact">Three companies control 75% of the cloud computing market</a> (Google, Amazon, Microsoft). That&rsquo;s without including Meta, as they aren&rsquo;t technically a cloud service provider. These companies sell computing power. AI is the most expensive product they have. The money rolls in once mass adoption is achieved and everyone is &ldquo;hooked&rdquo; on AI.</p>
<p>Apple is not a cloud computing company. In fact, they have tried to move mountains to keep computing locally on the device. Apple knows AI is a scam, but worse yet, it is not a money maker for them, in the future or otherwise. But the markets are foaming at the mouth for large language models.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s in Apple&rsquo;s best interest for AI to disappear. Apple Intelligence has the potential to leave a bad taste in billions of people&rsquo;s mouths.</p>

			 <p>Luigi Mangione&rsquo;s trial begins today. He has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet of what his lawyer had to say to the judge:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They&rsquo;re literally treating him like some political fodder; like some sort of spectical. He was on display to see on the biggest staged perp walk I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my career. It was absolutely unnecessary&hellip; There was no reason for the NYPD to have these big assault rifles, that frankly, I didn&rsquo;t even know was in their arsenal. And to have all the press there, all the media there, it was like perfectly choreographed.</p>
<p>And what was the New York City Major doing at this press conference? And frankly, I submit he [Eric Adams] was just trying to detract from those issues by making a spectacle of Mr. Mangione. And there are consequences to this. He has a right to a fair trial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mangione&rsquo;s attorney continues to call out Mayor Adams for calling Mangione a terrorist in front of potential jurors.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a lawyer (obviously) so I don&rsquo;t know what does or does not constitute a fair trial, but that perp walk and Eric Adams personal involvement seems so ill-advised.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While practical security systems are definitely required, we should not overreact to this singular incident in ways that keep us and our families from living normal lives. If we do, people with evil intent have already won.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s fascinating how the corporate elite truly believe they are the victims here. This guy made a literal list of solutions and not one of them was—<em>hey maybe we stop killing Americans for share holder value</em>.</p>
<p>He mentions the stat that 41% of Gen-zers are at best ambivalent to Brian Thompson&rsquo;s death. The last sentence quoted above then essentially calls an entire generation evil.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t care how anyone feels about the murder one way or another. Our world view, lived experiences, and privilege (or lack there of) will decide our opinion.</p>
<p>All I know is, when the Luigi story is over, health care companies will continue to send thousands of Americans to their grave each year. Healthcare executives will continue to make obscene amounts of money via bonuses from denying people care.</p>
<p>Regular people will continue to die needlessly. CEOs will be fine. They always are.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t spend too much time reading up on Hollywood. But, I vaguely recall the feeling that something was off with all the social media discourse around Blake Lively when “It Ends With Us” debuted. Being online, chronically speaking, you get a sort of sixth sense where you can spot inauthentic chatter. Even when there&rsquo;s nothing specific you can point to, little alarm bells ring.</p>
<p>Anyway, this exposé is fucking nuts. Public relations in the digital era is devious. With a few third-rate media connections and a modest army of social media bots, anyone can just spin up an alternate reality about anyone.</p>
<p>I wonder all the time, how much of what we consume is elaborate nudging campaigns or flat out lies? Not the obvious stuff. Not the disinfo that can be fixed with a little media literacy. But the stuff that flies completely under everyone&rsquo;s radar. The stuff we all just assumed to be true and may never learn otherwise?</p>

<p>In tech, some call it &ldquo;growth hacking,&rdquo; but I think that term is far too generous for what it is and divorced from what the practice entails. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this for a while now and have a name for it.</p>
<p><strong>Feature chum.</strong></p>
<p>I might do a proper write-up on my <a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz">main blog</a>, but for now, I want to flesh out the concept here.</p>
<p>Feature chum is a shady business goal presented to consumers as a useful feature to a company&rsquo;s product line or feature set. Feature chum always benefits the company&rsquo;s objective of obtaining more power and growth, but not necessarily valuable for the end user.</p>
<p>For example, do you remember Facebook&rsquo;s like button for external websites? You could add a like button to any webpage using a snippet of code. At the time, Facebook touted the like button as a way to increase engagement, traffic, and even sales.</p>
<p>This claim, and the like button itself, was a strategic misdirection. Years after it was released, we learned two things about that button.</p>
<p>One, Facebook&rsquo;s true intentions were to increase its ability to track Facebook users off its platform and gain a treasure trove of user data.</p>
<p>Two, we learned that the like button did not, in fact, increase engagement, traffic, or sales for the websites that used it.</p>
<p>Feature chum often debuts to the market highly subsidized and widely available so that it may achieve mass adoption quickly. This strategy is helpful because feature chum often has no inherent value to the user but is imperative to meeting the company&rsquo;s objective.</p>
<p>Because the specified business goal is the true motivation of feature chum, any potential user benefits are necessarily contrived and thus <em>secondary</em>, if such benefits exist at all.</p>
<p>The purpose of the “feature chum” method is to meet a specific business objective that would overwise be considered by the user base as outside the norm of acceptable business practices. No one would&rsquo;ve installed that like button if we knew Facebook&rsquo;s true intentions. And, of course, looking back on it, that button didn&rsquo;t do shit. We all just went along with it for some reason.</p>
<p>Feature chum obfuscates the primary business goal within a feature until mass adoption and full dependency on it are realized.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;ll likely do a more in-depth analysis and write up with more examples. But consider how this framing might change how we look at the Enshittification life cycle or how we can prevent it from happening in the future.</p>

<p>Good read. Not to get too conspiratorial, but I have often wondered about the existence of a shared blackball list—specifically, a list of &ldquo;content creators&rdquo; who are critical of big tech in a way that threatens their business.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a dividing line—before the list and after. Creators who found an audience before the list are less likely to get delisted from the algorithm. Smaller creators after the list was in place are all but guaranteed never to find an audience.</p>
<p>How my content performs outside of big social media, and even now, Bluesky, compared to the open web and true decentralized social media like Mastodon, is night and day. Without that comparison, I would have chalked it up to cope. But looking at the numbers, it&rsquo;s hard to ignore.</p>
<p>Such a list is currently impossible to prove without a whistleblower, but my bet is that it exists and is shared between companies.</p>

			 <p>On my second reading of the essay “A Linkless Web,” I remember the first book I ever read, and wonder if an AI-generated summary would&rsquo;ve robbed me of that experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://aeon.co/essays/when-ai-summaries-replace-hyperlinks-thought-itself-is-flattened">When AI summaries replace hyperlinks, thought itself is flattened | Aeon Essays</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In The Well-Wrought Urn (1947), he argued that a reader could not sum up a poem by paraphrasing what it ‘says’. Poetry does not work like ordinary language. It is not reducible to its propositional content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll have to read this essay multiple times. It&rsquo;s dense, and I suspect I&rsquo;ll take away something new to dissect with each reading. I&rsquo;m happy to do it.</p>
<p>For my second reading, my takeaway is the reading itself.</p>
<p>During summer break one year, I resisted the assignment of reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. I would&rsquo;ve much rather played around the courtyard in the back of our apartment. My mother encouraged me, inscribing the first page with a message to get lost in my imagination (or something like that). I wasn&rsquo;t completely convinced, but reading my mother&rsquo;s warm plea was enough for me to turn to the next page—and that page was enough for the next.</p>
<p>“The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” was the first novel I ever read, and it happened fast—two or three days from cover to cover. An astonishing feat for a kid with undiagnosed ADHD. That book helped me love reading and writing. My mother handing it to me on a warm summer day is a core childhood memory.</p>
<p>If I had AI at my fingertips, would I have ever told my mom about my homework assignment? Would I have ever read my first novel that summer? Or, with the excitement of ten-hour playtimes bouncing in my head, would I have simply asked ChatGPT for a summary the night before school?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not so old that I can&rsquo;t appreciate a new medium for creativity and imagination. I don&rsquo;t believe artificial intelligence to be inherently evil. But in the hands of Bezos? The man who all but destroyed the book market? Or, Zuckerberg, whose only crusade is increasing his time-on-site metric? Yeah, that worries me.</p>
<p>So, my question is, how important was that childhood experience for me? How important will it be for my future kids?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s cool that this company will attempt to open source the robot&rsquo;s cloud service, but did it need the cloud in the first place? No. VC&rsquo;s needed a revenue stream in the cloud.</p>

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you money.&rdquo; &ldquo;Okay give me money.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh it&rsquo;s all about the money?&rdquo; WHAT.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t even want the money. Even thought he <em>did</em> <a href="https://micro.fromjason.xyz/2024/12/19/update-on-the.html">pay someone else</a> $50 to “clone” the site. An apology would&rsquo;ve been cool. Owning up to it seems like something to do. Based on our conversation, my guess is he doesn&rsquo;t take it down and just blocks me instead. I looked at the site again, and its now different enough where I don&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>A friend said he sounds like a guy on a dating app after the woman rejects him hahaha.</p>

			 <p>I grew up on Curry Ford Road in downtown Orlando. Free market capitalism didn&rsquo;t help my mother when Wachovia Bank rearranged her debit charges to maximize overdraft fees the week before Christmas.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t help her when she pawned her dead mother&rsquo;s jewelry so that her kids could get presents that year. And it didn&rsquo;t help her fifteen years later when the bank settled a class action suit and my mom received a $33 check.</p>
<p>Poor people shouldn&rsquo;t have to pay for some rich Californian&rsquo;s ideals on free market economics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen how libertarians act under duress; when it&rsquo;s <em>their</em> lives being violated. And it&rsquo;s never half as bad as a poor person&rsquo;s Tuesday, and never with a thimble worth of their dignity.</p>

			 <h1 id="from-the-drafts-starved-for-hope-a-trolling-harris-feeds-us">[From the drafts] Starved for hope, a trolling Harris feeds us</h1>
<p><em>Here&rsquo;s an incomplete draft of mine from September 11th. During the months leading up to the election, I was very nervous. I wrote <strong>a lot</strong>. For whatever reason, I published none of it, effectively keeping myself a political diary of unfinished thoughts. After revisiting some of my mini-political essays, I may publish them here on my micro. If for nothing else, to connect with folks who felt the same way as I did.</em></p>
<p>Under the mountain of Donald Trump&rsquo;s lies is a bedrock composed of a single truth. It is the key to all of his power.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn&rsquo;t lose any voters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He offered that truth at the Iowa rally nearly a decade ago, and still, democrats refuse to acknowledge it. We still believe we can embarrass his voters enough to jump ship. But history is clear.</p>
<p>This fight is, and has always been, about one thing— the whiteness of America.</p>
<p>The overturning of Roe v Wade, the attacks on birth control and interracial marriage. They separate brown children from their mothers. It all points to keeping this country white.</p>
<p>And when it comes to preserving that identity at any cost, there is only one game in town. Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Take it from someone who trolled his cronies so hard that it <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/rudy-giuliani-falsely-blames-twitter-after-typo-points-anti-trump-n944136">made the news</a>.</p>
<p>No matter what he does; no matter how much we get under his skin, or call out his hypocrisies, he will always have the margin of error to win the presidency of the United States.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wang.social/post/3lberqlwpv22u">Peter Wang vowed to me he&rsquo;ll &ldquo;kill Bluesky PBC&rdquo; if things &ldquo;really go to shit,&quot;</a> launched $1mm fund to build on AT Protocol.</p>
<p>Wednesday, open-source entrepreneur Peter Wang <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/open-source-veteran-launches-skyseed---first-ecosystem-fund-and-incubator-for-the-bluesky-at-protocol-302329958.html">launched</a> a $1mm fund to spark more development on AT Protocol:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bluesky has clearly crossed over from serving mostly technical early-adopters into mainstream appeal,&rdquo; said Wang. &ldquo;While much has been written recently about Bluesky&rsquo;s stunning growth, its real power lies in the open protocol (AT Protocol) that the team has pioneered. The Skyseed Fund will accelerate and incubate innovation in that open ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last month on Bluesky, Wang and I went back and forth on the merits of the claim that Bluesky is &ldquo;billionaire proof.&rdquo; Journalists and prominent devs have been making this claim for months without solidifying how that would work. I just started reply-guying anytime I saw the claim on my feed—which was a lot.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted post, Eric Blair wrote, “Bluesky is much more resistant to billionaire takeover than Twitter was,&rdquo; so I asked if he could clarify. Blair didn&rsquo;t respond until much later in the conversation, and when he did, his reply was simply, &ldquo;<a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/protocols-not-platforms-a-technological-approach-to-free-speech">Protocols, Not Platforms</a>,&rdquo; like Moses might recite a commandment.</p>
<p>Peter Wang, on a separate thread, did reply. Multiple times. Honestly, I found it refreshing, if for nothing else, he was <em>trying</em> to answer the question.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what he said in response to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/fromjason.xyz/post/3lbeqc4tzhs23">my comment</a>:</p>

<p>Presumably, to calm my nerves, Wang then vows to kill the company if need be:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s startling to watch our media execute this very tactic on us with Luigi Mangione—<em>he grew up in a nice house, he went to an Ivy League school, he&rsquo;s &ldquo;one of us”</em> over and over again.</p>
<p>Regardless how you feel about the situation, there&rsquo;s no excaping the feeling that we are being herded like cattle. It&rsquo;s bizarre. It&rsquo;s icky.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>McCue’s best explanation of Surf’s big theory is this: in a decentralized social world, the internet will be less about websites and more about feeds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He who controls the feeds controls the (social) web.</p>
<p>This is interesting. It&rsquo;s almost like we have two new layers in the internet technology stack. We have the computational layer, or as I like to call it, <a href="https://fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/the-computational-web/">The Computational Web</a>— infrastructure, AI, recommendation engines, etc.—controlled by four hyperscalers. My bet is Meta will get in the game soon and quickly become the de facto cloud infrastructure for the social web (regulatory capture, and all that).</p>
<p>Then, we have the “App View” layer—aggregated feeds from decentralized ecosystems. Maybe Meta gets into this space, maybe not. With Meta funding the <a href="https://socialwebfoundation.org/">Social Web Foundation</a> and the newly formed <a href="https://www.anew.social/hello-social-web/">A New Social</a>, it seems like Zuck is content with giving up this layer in exchange for other considerations and loyalties.</p>
<p>So the question is, who controls the advertising networks for all the decentralized feed apps? AKA, who will profit from the art you post to your personal websites?</p>

<p>W3SWMW was curated lists of hyperlinks grouped by theme. I Love Websites was one-off sites. My micro blog was more of a traditional link blog with pull quotes and commentary. Each has a good concept (imo) but would be stronger together (also imo).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue to use the MicroBlog platform but will likely spruce up the place. Maybe even take the branding from W3SWMW as a starting point.</p>

<p>The most egregious part of this article, other than the heavily implied murder mystery conspiracy, is the claim that ChatGPT makes money.</p>

<p>Perhaps Bluesky matches this version of decentralization, but if so, it is because it is an incredibly weak definition of decentralization, at least taken independently. This may well say, taken within the context it is provided, &ldquo;users of this network may occasionally not rely on a gatekeeper, as a treat&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I believe it was Katherine Dee of <a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/defaultfriend">Default Blog</a> who said that eventually, trad media will try to pouch these creators and we&rsquo;ll start to see a bundling like with cable. I don&rsquo;t know which situation is worse/better.</p>
<p>Edit: yup, it was Katherine Dee in a post called <a href="https://default.blog/p/we-already-solved-subscription-fatigue">We Already Solved Subscription Fatigue</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A lot of small time creators, and I’m including myself here, don’t offer enough value to justify even $5/month. Which is why I think for people like me, we’ll probably see a return to bundling or networks, in one form or another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that I think about it, why aren&rsquo;t more writers just doing this independently? There are no real technology barriers. What&rsquo;s stopping five or so popular bloggers from &ldquo;bundling&rdquo; their work? Keep the price at five bucks with the hopes of attracting more paid subscribers.</p>

It&rsquo;s these same people who will tie themselves into intellectual pretzels justifying murdering children overseas.</p>

			 <p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate how the phrase “be kind to others” has become a war cry for the status quo. It&rsquo;s tosssd around as a way to silence descent and keep us smiling at our oppressors. Justice and kindness are not mutually exclusive ideas. Increasingly, the cruelest thing someone can do is mind their manners when witnessing abuse.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/06/special-series/disinformation-social-media-facts.html">Education Is Key to Fighting Disinformation on Social Media - The New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These groups can be broadly defined as people who have a deep distrust of authority and traditional sources of information such as governments, scientists, doctors or bankers. This distrust is frequently rooted in a sense of feeling betrayed or harmed by those authorities. There could be completely legitimate reasons — whether personal, social or political — for that sense of betrayal, but it often leads them online to seek alternative viewpoints outside the mainstream discourse. In doing so, they find communities that reflect and reinforce their feelings of skepticism and distrust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is spot on. Growing up poor and without a formal education doesn&rsquo;t make you dumb. It does, however, make you more vulnerable to disinformation. Not just because you&rsquo;re uneducated, though, it&rsquo;s also because growing up poor, you have a first-hand account of how rigged the system is against you. Where an educated, upper-middle-class person learns the theory of systemic oppression, a person of the lower classes lives it. That experience almost works against them.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager, maybe even into my early twenties, I would read Info Wars. Before I knew what liberal and conservative meant, I knew certain aspects of society were unjust. I knew what the cops were doing to me and my friends was wrong. Without a proper education, I listened to the first person who acknowledged these injustices. I got lucky growing up without modern social media. There wasn&rsquo;t a deep rabbit hole to fall into. We didn&rsquo;t have dopamine machines fine-tuning content to our worst neurosis.</p>
<p>Now, at 43, with age and self-education on my side, I have better tools to analyze the material conditions of my world. But my sense of justice has always remained.</p>
<p>This epidemic of young boys and men who understand enough about the world to know it&rsquo;s unjust but are not educated enough to know who to listen to is, in no small part, a problem with neoliberalism. Upper-middle-class people with wide-reaching influence on the web have spent the last decade telling poor people that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the system, the economy is fine, etc.</p>
<p>We turned our backs on these people. Of course, bad actors were there, willing to take them captive.</p>
<p>This is what makes the horseshoe theory complete bullshit. It derives from a false dichotomy. Liberal vs. Conservative is just a country-wide family fued over land and power between the bourgeoisie. What we are witnessing is not ideologies going so far left it ends up on the right. It&rsquo;s people understanding that the system is unfixable and the divide comes from who we choose to blame for it. Everyone else, liberal and conservative alike, are champions of the status quo, where the divide comes from who gets to rule over it all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not left and right, it&rsquo;s up and down.</p>

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s mythical moderate Republican voters, whom the party molded its entire platform to pursue, did not arrive to carry the party to the finish line. Instead, the pro-cop platform seems to have done nothing but legitimize Republican grievances and hand Trump a bolstered police and surveillance state</p>

<p>Before we rush to agree with political pundits that Democrats should continue scooching￼ right, know what sacrifice our party intends on making.</p>
<p>This is rhetoric matches what was floating around news blogs just before Democrats ditched trans rights and police reform to appeal to moderates.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve thrown every other marginalized identity into the moderate-conservative volcano. Bodily autonomy is the only remaining progressive issue on the Dem platform.</p>

The United States is a notorious outlier among developed nations for its lack of a national data-privacy law.

<p>The second misconception is that single-vendor Open Source is, somehow, the reasonable and business-conscious way to do Open Source. You should be on board if you want Open Source to win against proprietary software. But those companies are still doing what is, essentially, proprietary software: like the proprietary software companies of the 80s, they very much consider the software being produced as their exclusive property. They still intend to capture all the value that derives from it. And thanks to copyright aggregation or permissive licensing, they still can change the license any time they want. So it’s still proprietary: they just choose, for now, to release their software under an Open Source license.</p>

<p>If Facebook starts lobbying for the PACT Act, that’s potentially a big deal. Facebook was a key backer of FOSTA-SESTA, a bill that removed Section 230 protections for content violating anti-prostitution laws. That bill became law in 2018, and Facebook itself was fairly well-equipped to deal with the changes — while smaller sites like Craigslist got hit hard. The PACT Act could have similar effects. Facebook already has a legion of moderators and a policy team that releases detailed transparency reports. A smaller site could have far fewer resources. The PACT Act has a “small business provider” exception, but it’s a fairly narrow one.</p>

<p>Memos show that Amazon deliberately added confusion and complexity to the account cancellation process. Again, Amazon’s excellent UX designers excelled: cancellations dropped by 14% after the newly complexified cancellation workflow dropped (as one memo put it: “retention appears to be trending positively”).</p>
<p>Amazon called its Prime cancellation process “Iliad,” after Homer’s epic about an endless, grinding war.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite that success, and the App Store’s role in making it possible, Spotify pays Apple nothing. That’s because Spotify — like many developers on the App Store — made a choice. Instead of selling subscriptions in their app, they sell them on their website. And Apple doesn’t collect a commission on those purchases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting approach by Apple.</p>
<p>Consumers aren&rsquo;t as dumb as the openness camp thinks they are. The reason why the average person isn&rsquo;t rushing to support Spotify, Epic Games, and Meta, is because those companies are quantifiably anti-consumer.</p>
<p>Many would sooner cancel a subscription than give these companies unfettered access to their credit card and user data.</p>
<p>These tech bros might not see it now, but rushing to publicly defend a company like Meta is doing unreparable damage to their reputations and their openness religion.</p>

<p>That combination leans heavily on machines is my guess. Also, these articles rarely identify which platform the person was radicalized. Why?</p>

<p>I think this article is the closest thing we have to understanding the Threads / Mastodon interpolation initiative. At the very least, it gives us a framework to understand what feels like a heavily coordinated march.</p>
<p>What really drives this home; what transforms it from a simple article into a manifesto, is the ending:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not have to live in the world the new technocrats are designing for us. We do not have to acquiesce to their growing project of dehumanization and data mining. Each of us has agency.</p>
<p>No more “build it because we can.” No more algorithmic feedbags. No more infrastructure designed to make the people less powerful and the powerful more controlling. Every day we vote with our attention; it is precious, and desperately wanted by those who will use it against us for their own profit and political goals. Don’t let them.</p>

			 <p>For my last five or so essays, I&rsquo;ve settled into this writing process where each morning I&rsquo;ll write 500 words, which may or may not build on the previous morning&rsquo;s draft.</p>
<p>I do this until I have about three thousand words, and then I look for a common thread. If I find it, I edit. If I don&rsquo;t, I keep writing, or I throw it in drafts.</p>
<p>Or I cry. It&rsquo;s a coin toss, really.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, ChatGPT developer OpenAI revealed that it is collaborating with the United States Defense Department on cybersecurity projects and exploring ways to prevent veteran suicide, reports Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Kinda just sounds like they&rsquo;re making a suicide-prevention app for vets with no military application. Not sure why they took that part out the TOS.</p>

			 <p>A quick rant on that 2023 &ldquo;leaked&rdquo; <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither">Google memo</a> <em>&ldquo;We Have No Moat And neither does OpenAI&rdquo;</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the uncomfortable truth is, we aren’t positioned to win this arms race and neither is OpenAI. While we’ve been squabbling, a third faction has been quietly eating our lunch.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boy, does this entire memo smell of bullshit; a red herring; the ol' pit us against the lunch lady routine.</p>
<p>First, it implies Google and OpenAI are on equal footing. They&rsquo;re not. Google is far better suited to cash in on AI tech adoption—more on that in a sec.</p>
<p>It then identifies open-source AI models as the third faction about to &ldquo;eat [Google&rsquo;s] lunch.&rdquo; Again, <em>basura, bro</em>. Straight trash.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, open-source tech is great and important, and wonderful. But it&rsquo;s not like the average person runs a Large Language Model on their Mac to make grocery lists. If you are, in fact, doing this, you are a nerd and I love you. But you&rsquo;re not the average user.</p>
<p>Most AI-centered features, whether powered by open or proprietary tech, will be baked into consumer-facing software for mass consumption.</p>
<p>But, AI features are power-hogs and expensive to maintain. Look at ChatGPT. With one hundred million users and close to two billion in revenue, OpenAI is <em>losing</em> money. There&rsquo;ll be efficiency gains for sure. But not before they pay the pied piper.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my final point.</p>
<p>The SaaS model runs on the cloud. The cloud is effectively owned by three companies— Amazon, Microsoft, and, yes, Google. (Four companies if you count Meta, but that&rsquo;s <a href="https://fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/copy-acquire-kill-how-meta-could-pull-off-the-most-extraordinary-pivot-in-tech-history/">another rant</a>).</p>
<p>The big three are spending eye-watering amounts of capex dollars on data centers and reporting growth almost exclusively from cloud services. And that&rsquo;s without ubiquitous AI in all of our subscription software that folks actually want to use.</p>
<p><em>So go ahead</em>, says Google. Be fruitful and multiply those AI features. Open-source it up. We&rsquo;ll even give you the tech for free. Just call us when you launch your app and need that cloud service.</p>
<p>Because why give a shit who sells the milk jars when you own the motherfucking cows, baby!</p>

<p>What if we all just migrate over to the same google doc —@\DJWeduwen, Oct. 2022</p>

<p>It was around then, we all kind of knew Musk would eventually shit the bed. So for a brief moment, some of us migrated to an open Google Doc named NEW TWITTER. It was cool for a bit, then the yatizs arrived, and the doc went read-only.</p>
<p>It goes to show us, it doesn&rsquo;t take much for people to form a commune. Building a little digital community can be simple; sustainable even, so long as it remains small.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the <em>moderation</em> at scale that&rsquo;s hard.</p>
<p>Admins who protect their little digital green spaces aren&rsquo;t breaking the tenets of the internet. Those spaces are the manifestation of the web simply by existing. It&rsquo;s the land in which we build on that must remain open for all. Communities should govern according to their means.</p>

			 <p>Threads now lets you transfer your data to Google Drive, except it didn&rsquo;t work, and now Meta has all my Google data.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;feature&rdquo; is presumably part of the <a href="https://dtinit.org/">Data Transfer Initiative</a> funded by Meta and Google. Out of morbid curiosity, I tried it.</p>
<p>On its website, DTI states it&rsquo;s an &ldquo;organization dedicated to the mission of empowering technology users.&rdquo; Cool.</p>
<p>It seems more likely that Big Tech figured out it was better to trade our data amongst themselves, like baseball cards— I&rsquo;ll trade you this pregnancy announcement for that postpartum diagnosis.</p>
<p>Anyway, the first time I tried the transfer, Meta shot an error with a message that it needed more permissions. I granted. The second time, it created an empty folder in my Google Drive. The third time+, it stopped responding.</p>
<p>Why Meta needs to see all my Google Docs, plus the names and contacts of everyone I&rsquo;ve ever shared with, so that I can move some photos is unclear.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel very empowered, tbh.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m listing some blog platform recommendations for a friend, so figured I should just make that list public.</p>
<p><strong>The following are platforms I&rsquo;m familiar with:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear Blog</a>: Simple and loved in the blogging community. I believe it&rsquo;s free with a paid option. If I didn&rsquo;t have a custom site, I&rsquo;d probably use Bear, or Write.as.</p>
<p><a href="https://write.as">Write.as</a>: Also simple and loved. No free version though. Price starts at $6/mo. I used write.as for a few months and enjoyed it.</p>
<p><a href="https://neocities.org/">NeoCities</a>: Nostalgia! I love this concept. I haven&rsquo;t been through the set up process, but it looks like you may need to know some basic HTML/CSS. There&rsquo;s a social element with featured blogs. Service is free with a paid option. Some of my favorite blogs are on NeoCities.</p>
<p><a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>: Feature-rich. Geared toward professional publishers, but anyone can use. If you&rsquo;re just starting out, might be overkill. I used Ghost a few years ago, before its glow-up. It&rsquo;s a great platform. Starts at $9/mo. If you&rsquo;re adventurous, self-hosting a ghost blog is much cheaper.</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>: Simple to use but has some cool features. There&rsquo;s also a social element which I like. I use micro.blog daily for sharing interesting links. But long-form works just fine. Starts at $5/mo.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a>: Their blog feature &ldquo;weblog&rdquo; is still in beta. But I&rsquo;m adding them to the list because I love their service so much. It&rsquo;s also sort of difficult to explain. You get your own web address, a linktree-esque webpage, a Mastodon account on their server, plus some other cool stuff for $20/year. Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>A few platforms I&rsquo;m unfamiliar with but looked cool</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.are.na/">Are.na</a>: described as Tumblr meets Wikipedia.</p>
<p><a href="https://posthaven.com/">PostHaven</a>: Up to ten blogs for $5/mo.</p>
<p><a href="https://blot.im/">Blot</a>: Turns a folder into a website.</p>
<p><a href="https://typeshare.co/home">TypeShare</a>: Comes with an idea generator and outliner</p>
<p>A few recommends from the Mastodon community after posting:</p>

			 <p>There&rsquo;s some interesting parallels between the <strong>Technocracy movement</strong> of the 1930s and 40s, and a contemporary movement known as <strong>Effective Altruism</strong>.</p>
<p>Both ideologies promise a techno-utopia, if only we&rsquo;d give the world to its believers.</p>
<p>And both share some lineage— Joshua Norman Haldeman, 1940s director of Technocracy Inc, is the grandfather of Effective Altruism&rsquo;s most powerful evangelist, Elon Musk.</p>
<p>What a gnarly little coincidence.</p>

			 <p>Thinking about a #Meta pivot to infrastructure, and the subtle physiological effects it would have on our social media behavior.</p>
<p>The average user might keep their #Threads account, but signup for other platforms in the #Metaverse as &ldquo;sub-identities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For example— Taylor Swift launches a super fans platform. Would the average Swiftie migrate to the Meta-interoperable space? Or would they make a new account, one that perhaps better represents their fandom identity?</p>

<p>For the new year, I’m sharing my favorite bookmarks of 2023 to my <a href="https://micro.fromjason.xyz">microblog</a>. I will post “blogmixes” as a series of volumes. I don’t know how categorized these will end up, but I plan to post the entire collection on my <a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz">main site</a> towards the end.</p>
<p>As a caveat for the entire BlogMix series, any links I share are because I thought something about the content was interesting, important, wonderful, horrible, or otherwise noteworthy. Including a link does not necessarily mean I agree with a particular message. I considered labeling the links where I don’t agree, but that felt like it took the fun out of the project a bit. We’ll see. This is a new and evolving idea for me.</p>
<p>For this first volume, I included some posts and articles that I’ve either read, rediscovered, or revisited in 2023. I’ll almost certainly do another volume of just posts. Enjoy:</p>

<p>New plan: Each day I&rsquo;ll post a handful of links to my micro. Then, I&rsquo;ll categorize a big list on my main site next week. Is that a better plan? We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>The next major development in email deliverability included the standardization of reputation scores. ‘SenderScore’ and other reputation systems emerged at this time. False positives were further reduced by adding sender authentication mechanisms like Sender Policy Framework, SenderID, and Domainkeys Identified Mail.
Of course, if you&rsquo;re familiar with how these technologies work then you&rsquo;ll notice that most of them are reliant upon centralized gatekeepers who assign IP addresses and control domain registrations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The whole point of ActivityPub as an open protocol is to turn Twitter/Instagram-like social networking into something more akin to email: truly open. If Facebook were on the cusp of launching a Gmail-like email service, would you preemptively declare that your email server would block them? To me that’s what this “Anti-Meta Fedi Pact” is arguing for.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not about whether Meta can track us across the web. They don&rsquo;t need to the moment we start generating content for them.</p>
<p>Meta has proven time and again that it has no problem with using people&rsquo;s own data to affect their moods and actions.</p>

<p>And, as you might expect, there are hundreds of Catholic Fundamentalism blog posts that would be deeply controversial in most religious circles (“A protestant is a person who willfully disobeys Any Word of Christ” is a doozy). But the way they’re shared on Facebook means that next to no one is actually clicking through to read them. In fact, according to the site’s own traffic counts, <strong>that anti-Protestant post only has 23 views, but its Facebook post has over 7,000 reactions and a thousand comments</strong>. And it&rsquo;s those thousand comments that are the key here.</p>

<p>Weird Christian infighting aside, those figures are wild. I mean, if you told me that 23 people <em>accidentally</em> clicked on his post I&rsquo;d believe you.</p>

<li>Rage bait is a poor way to generate an audience.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>When a tech company designs a device for remote, irreversible, nonconsensual downgrades, they invite both external and internal parties to demand those downgrades. Like Pavel Chekov says, a phaser on the bridge in Act I is going to go off by Act III. Selling a product that can be remotely, irreversibly, nonconsensually downgraded inevitably results in the worst person at the product-planning meeting proposing to do so. The fact that there are no penalties for doing so makes it impossible for the better people in that meeting to win the ensuing argument, leading to the moral injury of seeing a product you care about reduced to a pile of shit</p>

<p>Great read. We&rsquo;re seeing the worst of SaaS; tech companies becoming so powerful that they can defraud their customers in broad daylight. The worst part is, not a single politician has any interest in regulating the companies they hold stock in.</p>

<p>Yeah, if Apple cared about security, why did they block a company whose entire business model hinged on faking iDevice authenticity? /s</p>

			 <p>From Vice: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxjbv9/apple-just-confirmed-governments-are-spying-on-peoples-phones-with-push-notifications">Apple Just Confirmed Governments Are Spying on People’s Phones With Push Notifications</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The process by which push notifications are generated requires the phone company to serve as a “digital post office,” Wyden wrote. Push notifications are sent through Apple and Google&rsquo;s servers, which means that the companies “serve as intermediaries in the transmission process,” and can therefore be made to hand over information to governments that request it.</p>
<p>According to Wyden’s letter, the information that can be gleaned from push notification requests is mostly metadata. This includes information “detailing which app received a notification and when, as well as the phone and associated Apple or Google account to which that notification was intended to be delivered,” Wyden wrote. In some cases, requesters may even receive unencrypted content such as the text that was delivered in the notification.</p>
<p>The senator said that companies can therefore “be secretly compelled by governments to hand over this information.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be so dope if we jumped on stories like this with the same tenacity and vigor as when an iMessage blue bubble story breaks.</p>
<p>Telecom companies are the most user-hostile in the biz.</p>

			 <p>Regarding ad blockers:</p>
<p>The web wasn&rsquo;t always for-profit. In fact, it was decidedly free and open for a time. Most people were content with how the internet was before corporations came and decided to monetize.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not so much an unwillingness to support platforms via ads; it&rsquo;s that some people are simply rejecting in its entirety the forced participation of the for-profit web.</p>
<p>They can&rsquo;t kill off all the indie platforms and then get mad when people don&rsquo;t fall in line.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing, and I know it sounds pedantic. AI isn&rsquo;t taking anything away from anyone. Rich <em>people</em> are taking jobs away from poorer people, in order to enrich themselves further; as the story always goes.</p>
<p>These very wealthy <em>people</em> just happen to be using AI at the moment to accomplish their ongoing fetish for working class suffering.</p>

			 <p>The shift away from the preverbal &ldquo;for you&rdquo;— finite, human-curated— and to towards the explicit &ldquo;For You&rdquo;— endless, algorithm-driven, bespoke— has stripped us of a sort of transparent &ldquo;social authority&rdquo; we once had with the hyperlinked-curated web.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Influencer,&rdquo; &ldquo;thought-leader,&rdquo; etc. are now tainted terms. But we still enjoy recommendations by those with &ldquo;good taste&rdquo; and implicit standards.</p>
<p>In an algorithm-driven web where tastemakers are corporate executives and content discovery is limited to our preferred social media silo, we&rsquo;ve lost the <strong>human curator</strong>.

<p>Human curators are like the missing wolves of Yellowstone— vilified creatures we allowed to be exiled. But, their absence is fucking up our ecosystem. And we know something&rsquo;s off; we talk about it every day.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://ia.net/topics/ia-writer-7">iA Writer 7, my favorite writing app, integrates ChatGPT (sort of)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The only person that can safely discern human from artificial text is the person writing. iA Writer now supports making the distinction. There’s no fancy ghost doing this for you. It’s up to you to decide how honest you want to be with yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The new version of <strong>iA Writer</strong> ( <em>not</em> AI Writer) will keep track of the text you paste from ChatGPT into the its app. Authorship is displayed at the end of the document. iA calls the new open format <a href="https://github.com/iainc/Markdown-Annotations">Markdown Annotations</a>, and hopes other developers expand on it.</p>
<p>I like it.</p>
<p>I think writers have soured on generative AI. Most won&rsquo;t go near it as a matter of religious conviction, so I wonder which will embrace this compromise. iA Writer is a <em>writer&rsquo;s</em> writer app. There seems to be a strong dichotomy between who uses services like ChatGPT and who doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>People&rsquo;s opinions on new things do soften over time, however, right? I kind of love that the folks at <a href="https://ia.net/">Information Architects</a> found a way to incorporate AI without minimizing creative efforts.</p>
<p>Of course, you sometimes must declare your pasted text as AI-generated. Pasting from desktop appears to auto-detect from ChatGPT. Most companies like OpenAI and Midjourney don&rsquo;t seem too interested in creating a digital watermark for AI content, which I suspect would help here. It&rsquo;s a problem. <a href="https://fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/madonna-in-the-80s-ai-already-tainting-our-history/">Ask Madonna</a>.</p>
<p>Edit: I titled this post <em>iA Writer 7 keeps you honest</em>, but on further reflection I think it does more than that. I think it gives skittish writers permission to use AI without feeling like a fraud. Our memories aren&rsquo;t always that great. And we sometimes forget to look back at our work with kind eyes. No one wants to read an old post and wonder if some AI prose slipped in. I don&rsquo;t use AI for writing anything other than work outlines. But I can see value in a GPT assistant helping me flush out ideas. The ability to do that and document the process is pretty cool.</p>

<p>I love the way certain styles cluster over time. Or how some aesthetics appear once then disappear, while others maintain an ebb and flow that can span decades.</p>
<p>Frutiger Aero has seen a resergence in interest (or so it seems, I learned the proper name for the aesthetic just last year). I wonder if it&rsquo;ll make a comeback.</p>

<p>Pentagram saw an opportunity to turn Snoo into a character as iconic as Super Mario and cement its role as Reddit’s mascot by formalizing its shape and details. This process involved taking the existing 2D Snoo icon and rendering it in 3D, with the kind of nuanced character development that goes into designing Pixar characters. Snoo’s new 3D form—and a new menu of emoji-like Snoos—opens the door for the character’s next act. It also lays the groundwork for a new core illustration style, transitioning from spot illustrations that lack a common thread, to heroic 3D icons, all unified in form.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the industrial firms that Marx and Smith wrote about, tech firms like Google differ in one key aspect: how they turn a profit. Where industrial firms extract profits from the gap between value produced and what workers get paid in wages, internet platforms rely foremost on rents, which generate profit on the basis of existing property, intellectual or otherwise. No additional labor is needed for each unit of output; profit thus becomes fundamentally extractive, or “unproductive” as Marx, or even classical economists like Smith and Ricardo, would say. For companies like Google, rent comes from owning the infrastructure through which we live our digital lives. The vast majority of Google’s windfall profits—$60 billion in 2022—come from rents.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m using defined tags to filter my public bookmarks. Posts with lots of ads will be tagged as &ldquo;<strong>adicles</strong>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;posts&rdquo; tag is exclusive to personal &ldquo;sites.&rdquo; &ldquo;Articles&rdquo; come from &ldquo;orgs&rdquo; and &ldquo;agencies,&rdquo; so forth, and so on.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I&rsquo;d like to share a piece from a big publication, like: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a> (1945) by Vannevar Bush for The Atlantic.</p>
<p>Because of all the ads, that page is not a &ldquo;post&rdquo; or an &ldquo;article&rdquo; in fromjason land. It&rsquo;s a piece of revenue-generating content with a degraded reading experience (of no fault of the author, obviously).</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m adding an &ldquo;<strong>adicle</strong>&rdquo; tag for such occasions.</p>
<p>Adicles exist solely to generate ad revenue with no considerations for the reading experience (or substance in many cases). Still, some adicles contain writing worth a share. I&rsquo;ll just be sure to label it what it is: ads with a splash of prose.</p>

			 <p>I wanted my micro.blog bookmarks public and filtered, so I did some digging:</p>
<p><a href="https://micro.blog/sod">@sod</a> has a great <a href="https://github.com/svendahlstrand/plugin-bookmarks-shortcode">public bookmarks plug-in</a>. Effortless setup.</p>
<p>I then stumbled on <a href="https://micro.blog/pratik">@pratik</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://microblog.pratikmhatre.com/2023/08/15/thanks-to-heylouras.html">post</a> sharing their <a href="https://microblog.pratikmhatre.com/faves/">faves page</a>, which led me to <a href="https://micro.blog/heyloura">@heyloura</a>&rsquo;s code to <a href="https://paste.lol/loura/micro-blog-bookmarks-shortcode">filter bookmarks by tag</a>.</p>
<p>I get to work on my bookmarks page today because of their contributions. Hooray for smart and generous people.</p>

<p>Writing is thinking. iA Writer is designed to make thinking enjoyable. A writing app that thinks for you is a robot that does your jogging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What surprised me the most about our new AI-capable world is the expressed disdain for human creators (artists) by &ldquo;AI artists&rdquo; (prompters). There&rsquo;s this attitude that creativity itself has been an injustice to non-creative people. And that AI is here to square that circle.</p>
<p>People who sell art for profit, but cannot experience the joys of creativity, view artistry as a liability. To them, it&rsquo;s nothing more than a supply chain bottleneck. It&rsquo;s manual labor to be automated away.</p>
<p>But of course, the economic efficiencies promised by generative AI isn&rsquo;t enough for them. &ldquo;Prompt artists&rdquo; demand all the creative accolades too. They want the gold medal placed around their necks after their robot finishes the race.</p>

<p>Maybe my favorite internet manifesto. I go back to it often because it&rsquo;s incredibly funny prose. But also, when I&rsquo;m itching to complicate things, I need it to reel me in. Even if it&rsquo;s satire.</p>
<p>Oh lord, forgive me for my contributions to the corporate web. I&rsquo;ll try to make up for it in my personal portfolio. #webdesign #corporateweb</p>

<p>I love that the PDF is saved as &ldquo;Nytimes firefox final&rdquo; All these years, and we haven&rsquo;t found a versioning system better than appending &ldquo;final&rdquo; to the file name.</p>

			 <p>Well, cellular-powered Macs. 5G is assumed. Unless they use some other technology.. 👀</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/macbook-integrated-cellular-modem-2028/">MacRumors</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing in his latest Power On newsletter, Gurman says that Apple&rsquo;s custom technology aspirations include integrating an in-house modem into its system-on-a-chip (SoC), which would eventually see the launch of MacBooks with built-in cellular connectivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a wild conspiracy theory that iPhone&rsquo;s Emergency Satellite service is a precursor to a fully-Apple cellular network. What better way to kick off the new service than with a satellite-connected  MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, I&rsquo;ll be first in line for a Mac I can use without coffee shop WiFi.</p>
